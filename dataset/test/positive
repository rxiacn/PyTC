i came into this book expecting one thing .
after the first part , perhaps an accident , my expectations had completely altered .
as i read through the second part , marquesa de montemeyor , my expectations were slowly changing even more .
by the beginning of the third part , esteban , my expectations had transformed so much they were hardly recognizable .
i came into it expecting a novel about a man of religion 's struggle with faith .
by the first few pages i came to realize it had much more of a non-fiction lean , at this point i was scared of being bored .
as i started to read part two i began to realize it was n't about this brother juniper at all but the people in the accident .
throughout parts of the first chapter i have to admit i did feel bored , but near the end it caught fire and i was wowed by the first part 's finish .
this reinvested my firm belief that the ending of a short story will completely redeem it , for that 's what each part was : a short story telling the complete life of one of the victims in the accident of the bridge .
the story of thornton wilder 's pulitzer prize winner is that a bridge ( the finest bridge in all of peru ) snapped and five travelers fell to their death .
brother jupiter decided to use this accident to prove that it was god 's will .
this man found it more difficult than he expected discovering an ambiguity in life that he had not seen .
basically the novel to me is detailing the complexity and mystery of life .
i would say the way the bridge of san luis rey was written was , generally , not exceptionally appealing to me .
it was told almost exactly like a textbook account of the events .
using this method though , there were dazzling moments when the book flowed like poetry .
the book also seemed slightly tedious at times .
certain sections were difficult to get through but as i pressed on i felt a certain gratification , in knowing that i was being shown snapshots of life that were almost as real as they get .
despite these downfalls ( which had their upshots as well ) , the meaning of the book made it for me .
the characters were all taken on spiritual journeys and though each story ended in death , which was a death too early for all of them , there was a certain bittersweet happiness in their soulful accomplishments .
in total i would suggest the bridge of san luis rey but only if you 're willing to fully concentrate whenever you pick this book up .
it can be a beautiful book but only if first acknowledged as a tough book

the boom mr. dent speaks of has begun-but is starting in the population centers of the far east and is being partially digitally controlled by companies here in america .
the boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers .
since so many of our publicly-traded companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations , they are using that cost-savings in order to finance the implementation of sarbanes-oxley .
the net effect is that sarbanes-oxley is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of u.s. publicly-traded companies .
this is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets .
large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws .
so the industries that will expand will primarily focus around :

1 .
baby boomer spending
2 .
competitive advantage exports

i purchased weber 's art of the grill at the same time as weber 's big book of grilling .
i feel that with this book they went for a more upscale level of grilling which is fine .
i would recommend this book to anyone new to grilling or an old pro .
it is well layed out and the pictures are of high quality .
as in the other weber cookbooks , the format is easy to use and well thought out .
if you are looking for a more &quot ; beginner&quot ; weber grilling book check out weber 's big book of grilling , you ca n't go wrong with it .
i was glad i purchased both

you probably know joel siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on good morning america .
but do you know the rest of the story ?
here 's a chance to find out .
mr. siegel became a father for the first time at age 54 , and his son , dylan , was born on the day mr. siegel finished chemotherapy for colorectal cancer .
that cancer later spread to his lungs , and two more cancer surgeries and treatments followed .
mr. siegel 's marriage did not last , but his love for dylan did .
realizing that his chances of living to see dylan grow up are limited , mr. siegel decided to write down all of the wonderful things he wanted to share with dylan over the next few decades .
.
.
but might not be able to .
the result is a touching memoir with a heart that will cause you to shed more than an occasional tear while appreciating mr. siegel 's love for his son .
mr. siegel writes well , has had many interesting experiences , and retains his sense of wonder .
he is open about many of his faults ( which have led to failed marriages ) , but remains cautiously optimistic .
.
.
and careful .
dedicating the material to his son makes the memoir more personal and meaningful than almost any other memoir that i have read .
anyone with an open heart would enjoy and benefit from this book .
if you are like me , you expected to mainly hear about the movies .
.
.
and you will .
but there 's much more in the book about mr. siegel 's family , jewish heritage ( there 's even a yiddish dictionary with hilarious definitions ) , illnesses , past marriages , and advice for dylan .
the show business stories are almost all ones that i had not heard before , and will reward those who are primarily looking for this feature .
although you might think these are only about the movies , he also was a music critic and got to know the beatles in the early days .
i was particularly interested by mr. siegel 's first-hand accounts of working for civil rights in the south , helping with bobbie kennedy 's campaign , and how he helped his wife , jane , with her fatal illness .
one of the thoughts you will have as you read this book is how you would write a parallel one for either your children or your grandchildren to play the same role in sharing knowledge and love across the generations .
i hope you will read this book and feel inspired to either transmit your own lessons in your own way .
.
.
or to create the book you want to share with your descendants .
in any case , keep a hanky handy !

how does she do it ?
this will forever be one of my favorite books .
reading about the astoundingly crazy life mary karr had as a child made me wonder how her sense of humor could be so sharp and perfect and still get across the sadness and pathos without making me feel bad or hopeless .
nor did i feel that she was in a hopeless situation .
it always seemed as though there were morsels of goodness somewhere to be found .
a profoundly inspiring book .
i only hope i can be as resourceful and resilient

wilson does n't spend two paragraphs explaining how the snow clung to the trees .
he tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life .
you get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire .
it 's scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds .
when he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite , you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow .
it 's amazing that wilson could write such a detailed history forty years after the events occurred , but maybe even more amazing that he does n't embellish the situations .
there is little reflection on an event because he 's off describing the next firefight or lost buddy .
the most frustrating parts of the book were seeing raw officers replacing fallen soldiers rather than promoting the battle proven officers in the field .
it was not only unfair , but unsafe and yet the bigwigs away from the fighting did n't know the difference .
the title refers to a commander who told wilson before he went into battle that he 'd be promoted if he survived .
the promotions were slower coming than his successes and yet the war is such a long way away from this retired insurance salesman that he does n't seem that upset about his treatment .
it turned out to be the experience of his life .

my hat 's off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review .
it is beyond anything i 've ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines .
unlike the embedded journalists of our own time , the writers and photographers who covered vietnam were much closer to being free agents , restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of america 's military presence in southeast asia ( " there it is .
.
.
) , while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself .
unable to remain objective or even conceive of objectivity , herr and his colleagues yield to a kind of hallucinatory experience , depicting the war as a phantasmagoria , a really bad trip that also seduced them with what one of them insists is a compelling glamour .
to read this book is to experience vietnam not as a historical record or analysis , or even a personal memoir , but as a kind of hypnotic nightmare from which many , including survivors , never wake

in 2003 i suffered my worst major depression ever .
it lasted for over a year , and in the worst moments -which lasted months- my anguish was so intense that i wished i were dead .
again , the worst part was when i could n't even get a full night 's rest , and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. full of despair , unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief , and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching... having to get up in the morning was hell .
needless to say i could n't work , and that increased my ill-feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four ( we have two adolescent kids ) .
reading andrew solomon 's book , which i found recommended at depression-blog at blogspot dot com was an extraordinary experience , because for the first time ever i found my own reflected on the written page by a gifted writer who has also suffered the extreme anguish and pain of major depression .
in my illness , i found that psychiatrists , doctors and other therapists who have n't themselves gone through the hellish nightmare of a major depression simply can not understand what it is like .
it 's just like what happens with someone who has never eaten an orange : no matter how much you you try to explain how it tastes , the other person will have no real understanding unless he/she eats one him/herself .
same with friends and well-wishers of many sorts , who will tell you things like " cheer up !
" or " make an effort !
" without realizing that that 's precisely what you would most want to do -but ca n't .
solomon 's book and the advise of mike s. -now a friend , and the guy who created the depression-blog at blogspot dot com- have been of great value to me .
and of course the courage and love of my wife , who never -even in the worst moments , when we both thought i might die at any moment- abandoned hope , sustaining me , putting up with a lot , holding me when i cried in utmost despair and wished i were dead as the only relief in the midst of what now i recall as the worst kind of torture a human being can be subjected to.. .
and my kids , too , who at times even made me laugh with a joke or helped me get some sleep with a massage .
and god , who in the midst of utter darkness and despair , was there too , and saw me through

when considering the faith of the founders of the u.s , it is easy to rely on half-truths and assumptions .
david holmes dispels a lot of myths in his well-researched book which uses historical documentation , personal letters , and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused .
he begins by describing the religious movements of the 18th .
century which influenced our founders .
one interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government-sponsored churches , a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation .
although many of the people he describes , including george washington , benjamin franklin , and thomas jefferson , were brought up in orthodox christian churches , such as episcopal and congregational , they were later influenced by the deist movement which opposed many orthodox christian views .
he describes some interesting practices , such as the fact that george washington would leave anglican services before participating in communion , despite the fact that his wife martha would stay for the sacrament .
this is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the deist leanings of her husband .
holmes concludes his book with a brief description of modern-day presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers ' did .
in writing this book holmes displays an impartiality which is fitting for an historian , and which makes it all the more believable

this volume contains entries that deal with concepts , events , persons , and movements in u.s. history .
the length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered .
in addition , the entires both inform the reader with up-to-date information and indicate how revisionist historians have resahped opionions or refocused the discipline .
the entries are clearly written and eminently readable .
they are persuasive in thier opionions , yet respectful of other stances .
the cross references are helpful and ample .
the same obtains for the bibliographies .
the oxford companion to u.s. history far surpasses some other contemporary dictionaries in u.s. history .
its articles are treated in more depth and greater nuances .
the entries in the other dictionaries are too short and far too superficial .
i would highly recommend this for people involved in serious historical study and research

as a " follower of christ " ( christian ) who considers himself an evangelical protestant , this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart .
for all christian believers , the richness and power of brother lawrence 's life 's witness and words are a fountain of truth , a treasure that is as elegant ( spiritually ) as it is simple .
for the non-believers , i am afraid that reading this booklet ( a spiritual treasure in disguise ) will just confirm st. paul the apostles 's words that " the message of the cross is ... foolishness to the gentiles " ( 1 corinthians .
1 : 18 , 23 and 2 : 14 ) .
the only way to do justice to this booklet is to quote from it and let you get a taste of it .. .
this is a unique biography because it is not compiled by the brother lawrence of the resurrection ( birth name nicholas herman but known by his monastic name ) but by the ones around his life in 17th century france .
thus one learns very little about the beginnings of his life but very much about his godly lifestyle in the last 30 years of life of bliss ( presence of god in his heart ) and suffering ( 3 physical and debilitating ailments ) .
we learn about this spirit-filled vessel in god 's vineyard - brother lawrence , by reading the eulogy of the abbot of lawrence 's christian community , 4 short notes of his conversations with his spiritual father - abb ?
de beaufort , 16 very short letters of spiritual advice and encouragement brother lawrence wrote to friends and seekers , a manuscript found at his death called " spiritual maxims " and a memoir of a leader in the church in france .
the followings are a selection of the many highlights and underlined phrases and sentences from this book :

" busy yourself with keeping your mind in the presence of the lord .
"

" my most normal habit is to simply keep my attention on god , and to be generally and lovingly aware of him .
"

" i occupy myself solely with keeping my attention on god and by being generally and lovingly aware of him .
"

" we have an infinitely good god who knows what we need .
"

" console yourself with the one who keeps you fastened to the cross .
"

" we should love our friends , but without prejudicing the love of god which must be first .
"

" think often about him ; worship him without ceasing .
life and die with him .
this is the beautiful call in the life of a christian .
"

" ...we should love one another through our words of counsel and even more through our good examples .
"

" ...our only business in this life is to please god .
... my little progress in the path of perfection .
"

" i applied myself to practicing the presence of god .. .
doing this gave me such a high esteem for god that faith alone was capable of satisfying me .
"

" a devout woman told me that the spiritual life is a life of grace that begins with service fear , increases through the hope of eternal life , and is consumated by pure love .
"

my prayer : may we all experience god 's love , which truly can consume all other passions , and be filled with his grace which will empower us to truly love our neighbors ( christian and non-christian ) as ourselves .
this is my life goal

it 's pretty impressive to think that a book like " hiroshima " was written , and appreciated , less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped .
john hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the atomic age .
interviewing six survivors , hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city .
pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not .
the color of your clothing means everything .
white clothes reflect the heat , while dark clothing absorbs it .
even if you survive the initial blast , what you see next might make you wish you had n't .
but human beings are stubborn creatures , and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances .
i have been to the hiroshima peace park several times , and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal .
it is a humbling experience , and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes .
hersey 's book has a similar impact , being told in such a clinical , observational writing style that you ca n't help but be moved by the reality of it all .
my one criticism of " hiroshima " is the cast of characters that hersey chose to showcase .
for some reason , they seem to be largely christian , including a german jesuit priest and a japanese methodist minister .
with christians being such a tiny percentage of the japanese population , considerably less than 1 % , the choice to interview japanese christians seems a deliberate one .
hersey is telling the largely-christian us readers , " see ?
they are n't heathen devils .
they are christians , just like you and me .
that 's who we dropped the bomb on .
that 's who we killed .
" this puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book , and has hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was

this item is a must-have for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ( lds or mormons for short ) .
while not an authentic artifact , it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of america 's most successful and controversial social-religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries .
this reproduction allows the reader to read the original 19th century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of joseph smith ( author and proprietor ) to the pen ( s ) of his various scribes .
when the book is placed in it 's historical context , the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current lds church as well as smith 's answers for many of the religious concerns of his day .
also , interestingly , when compared to the current version of the book and the lds church today , the reader can see the evolution of church doctrine over time .
for example :

the development from a monotheistic doctrine of deity ( see book of 1 nephi and mosiah - also see lectures on faith , also by smith ) , to the current polytheistic doctrine that the church espouses ( see current version of the book of mormon - changing of the text in 1 nephi to correspond with current church doctrine ) .
the original condemnation of polygamy ( marriage to more than one wife at a time ) with the exception of raising up a righteous posterity ( see book of jacob ) , to the open endorsement and practice of the same from the mid to late 19th century for no reason other than smith saying that god commanded the practice , then to the abandonment of the practice in order to prevent church property from being confiscated and to allow utah statehood in the union .
the condemnation of secret , oath-bound clandestine societies ( see book of helaman , 3 nephi , ether ) to the practice of blood oaths of secrecy , loyalty and revenge ( for the murder of smith ) in the masonic-derived nauvoo temple endowment .
the original condemnation and futility of baptism for children and those that die without the law ( see book of mormon - name of a section within the book ) , to the practice of performing all church ordinances ( including baptism ) vicariously for the dead ( those that died without the law ) .
like all religious/social/mass movements , the lds church will evolve and change to meet the needs of its members .
the importance of this book for any follower of the religion ( or student of sociology , history , etc .
) is to chart the origins of the institution and then follow it 's metamorphosis over time as the institution attempts to adapt to a constantly changing and growing market .
for that reason alone the book receives 5 stars .

having read all of mccarthy 's other books already , i came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content .
and i was not disappointed .
mccarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters .
the vivid description of the mountains , the people , and their culture puts the reader right there in the story .
these harsh , terse , and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long , long time .
i found this story a little more abstract than most of mccarthy 's other works , yet i was able to see his message in the end .
required reading for any mccarthy fan

i bought this book along with saving dinner and saving dinner for the holidays last year .
i love the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping .
we went through the entire book and i have to say , it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods .
also , the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance " what 's for dinner " and be ready to prepare it .
the only cons i can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly , and you will need to be an open minded eater .
if you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household , this may not be the book for you .
also , our grocery bill for two went up from about $ 75 a week to $ 125 because of the veggies and meats .
good , healthy quality food ingredients , but unfortunately , painful to the wallet .
that said , i have never seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one , the food is good , the variety is there , and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond " bunless burgers " and eggs and bacon .
overall , i would recommend leanne 's saving dinner books .
for the open minded foodie .
or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list .
these books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress

so here is a collection of essays by jonathan franzen , the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001 , the corrections .
many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as harper 's and the new yorker--so , readers should know what they 're getting into .
i read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of franzen as a corporeal human being , and not just some exalted author of an award-winning novel .
overall , i liked most of the essays appearing in this collection .
from the promising opener , in which franzen poignantly recounts his father 's slow descension into quietus from alzheimer 's , we progress to a quasi-portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in america , before ashcroft and the patriot act invaded the american lexicon .
why bother ( which was previously referred to as the harper 's essay ) is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the 21st century as a tool of social reform ; the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform , but , should rather be written--ultimately-- for plain old entertainment value , franzen seems to argue .
some of these essays seem to be a little discursive ; franzen evidentally has a lot to say , and seems to forget what the initial point of his arguments are , going off on long tangents ; such as in mr .
difficult , where as some other reviewer stated , he begins with an interesting exploration of his artistic need to be " pretentious , " but then slowly veers off into a history and ode to author william gaddis .
franzen once again proves to be a smart and sophisticated reader and writer , and this book perfectly showcases his aptitude for social commentary , without pontificating or being too offensively forward .
people may consider franzen an " elitist , " but i consider him to posses a well-read , inquisitive mind ; there are far too few jonathan franzens around these days

i would first like to start by saying that the picture of dorian gray is , by far , one on my favorite novels .
and were i not slightly dissapointed with this particular edition of the novel i would have given it 5 stars , without a doubt .
it is a fabulous story , i would recommend it to anyone .
[ as a small sidenote -- i would simply like to say that wilde 's particular style of writing is one which i do , in general , find rather enjoyable .
] i have heard some people say that they found this book diffucult to muddle through .
i was not one of these people .
also , the other stories in this book are not bad at all .
i enjoyed the happy prince quite thoroughly .
- * note this particular " fairy tale " was very reminiscent of hans christian anderson 's writings .
the flaw ( s ) !
i blame the editor for this one -- this book , as far as i have been able to find , does not include the alternate ( slightly more drawn-out ) ending to this novel .
i was , needless to say , a little upset by this missing detail .
( if i have merely overlooked this extended ending , by all means let me know )
another small flaw -
if you have not read the book do not , i repeat do not , begin by reading the authors note .
although the authors note was very insightful and generally enjoyable to read - it easily gives away more than half the plot .
the authors note is a spoiler -- beware .
overall , still a great novel .
not so happy with the editor

ironically , socialist , anti-american , iconoclastic professor taylor , could be , at least in this work , the inspiration for the great david irving 's more pathbreaking work on an unneccesary and destructive war .
it is demonstrated that adolph hitler , the popular nationalist german leader , was no more responsible , and in many ways less so , than the so-called allies , who foolishly guaranteed poland , only to give her over to jewish bolshevism at yalta .
by refusing to grant germany 's rightful place as a continental power , britain and france lost millions of lives , their world empires , and their economic prominence .
the sole beneficiaries of this needless conflict were the soviets and their western fellow travellers .

i really enjoyed this book .
it took me a while to read it , about 2 months , because it 's definitely not fast paced .
i was glad i had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand .
mr. darcy is " pride " and elizabeth bennett is " prejudice " .
these two are made for each other , unbeknown to themselves .
this is essentially the story of how they fall in love , with lots of twists and turns .
i really like mr. darcy .
he is the perfect gentleman .
he is readily willing to admit his own faults , when they are brought to his knowledge .
he also does n't retaliate when rejected by elizabeth and accused of things he did n't do or that are misunderstood .
elizabeth is also wonderful .
she is doubtful about people and quite cynical .
i really like that about her .
it makes for some great banter between darcy and herself .
my favorite part of the book is when elizabeth see darcy at pemberly .
this is where i think she begins to fall in love with him .
pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself .
i would probably be charmed by him too !
this book took a little commitment to get through , but once i got into it , i could n't wait to see what happened next , even though i already knew the story .
i recommend it to anyone who enjoys regency england

i liked track of the cat , but i did n't love it .
the idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one i found appealing , but the plot was , at times , predictable .
the setting was well-drawn , but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional .
the clincher , though , is that i 'm not sure yet just how captivating anna pigeon is as a main character .
i believe that this is her first story , so i do n't want to make a snap judgement , but anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a sherlock holmes or miss marple .
that would be expecting a lot , i know , but frankly she is n't even as engaging as , say , gideon oliver or sharon mccone or brother cadfael , and she lacks the depth and power of a harry bosch .
as i said , the jury is still out for me here .
i liked track of the cat , but i was n't wild about it .
it 's a solid first try , and i 'll certainly read another anna pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series .
i expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable .
i recommend it , but my recommendation is a mild one

exposure to harv eker 's millionaire mind intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago .
i also attended the guerilla business school , a $ 2500 intensive .
what is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually ( as it did with me ) shift your perspective , if you are at all open to having it shifted .
getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones .
this book may help you , but the seminar will help you more .
the millionaire mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me .
i am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called zerodollarmarketer dot com .
being rich is a matter of perspective .
true wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind , my relationships , and lastly my pocketbook .
but its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month .
a journey worth pursuing

this is one of my favorite books of all time , and during my 40 years of life i 've read a lot of them .
first off : the style is simple and direct - no big words and no long sentences .
but this is by no means to imply that it is unsophisticated .
as the product of a 19-20 year old mind , it impresses .
it reads very much like a modern novel .
this is the kind of novel you wish you could have written yourself - at any age , let alone 19 or 20 .
as such , it is remarkable .
secondly : the subject matter is disturbing yet something that must be taught .
educated people should know how easy it is to become a hypocrite when how one behaves is determined solely by how he believes the public will react .
matthew lewis was not concerned about this .
this is what makes him such a great writer .
too many contemporary authors are more motivated to write what they believe the public will like than what is in their hearts .
lewis ' book created a sensation when it was published .
he probably realized that he was writing a controversial book , but he believed strongly that what he had to say was the truth and that it should be said .
after all , he was writing during the french revolution , while the reign of terror was raging in paris .
people were just beginning to become disillusioned with reason ( because of what they felt it had led to in france ) , but had yet to become infatuated with sentimentality and passion ( as they would during the romantic era ) .
as such , then , it was a time of transition .
lewis must have been aware of the danger ( as he saw it ) of people turning back ( as they had during the middle ages ) to religion for answers in a time of such upheaval .
he obviously felt that more religion was not the answer , that too much religion can pervert the mind just as too much reason can .
this is why his work is still relevant today .
the battle over what role religion is to play in society still rages today .
these are only a few thoughts i hope will be helpful to those who might consider reading this book .
on the surface , the book is a delightful romp into a fantasy realm .
underneath , though , there is a deeper current which reflects the broader course of history and still resonates today

as one reads peter pan , one does n't have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim .
i had ridiculously high expectations of mr. barrie 's imagination before purchasing this title , and he has fulfilled them completely .
many parts of the story are nothing but nonsense , which i enjoy above all else .
mr .
darling , the head of the darling family , commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine he 's supposed to take .
he brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs .
unfortunately for him , during his bragging his medicine is found , and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three .
sure enough , when three is reached , everyone except mr .
darling takes their medicine , and mr .
darling once again tries to hide his .
this kind of scenario is what i 'd call mark twain nonsense .
you can imagine it being true , even though it 's quite high up on the ridiculous scale .
then there 's what i would classify as over-the-top nonsense - aka bull - which there is plenty of in barrie 's original story of peter pan .
going back to mr .
darling , if we take a look at how he 's doing near the end of the book , we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel .
ah , yes...grown men in pet taxis .
what could be more fun than the " he-did n't-even-try-to-make-this-belivable " silliness of such a scene ?
to be honest , i do n't know if i 'd even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this .
other silly parts of the book involve wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls ; the narrator claiming he hates mrs .
darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later ; the lost boys asking wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it ; the narrator using the phrase " woke into life " because peter likes the word " woke " more than " wakened ; " and my favorite , captain hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark .
i believe the novel version of peter pan was written after the author had already established peter pan as a successful play .
that may explain a lot about the colorful narration , which takes many , many literary liberties .
we see everything from blatant narrator interference with the characters in the story to the shameless attempt at informing the audience that the narrator only chooses to make the events in the story happen a certain way so certain characters in the book wo n't be disappointed .
perhaps without these wacky ( and maybe even insane ) traits in the narration , there 'd be no reason to read the book , since it would be no different from the play .
after reading the peter pan novel though , i 'd have to say it almost seems criminal to watch an adaptation of peter pan without any wacky narration .
contrary to most adaptations of peter pan , the individual lost boys ( of where there are six i believe ) are actually more developed as characters than john or michael darling .
heck , at the end of the book they actually end up moving out of the neverland to live with the darlings and grow up to busy themselves in interesting professions .
i may not like the actual land of neverland as much as i like the land of oz , but barrie 's narration is unbeatable in my opinion .
he could probably make a jeopardy contestant 's friday night schedule sound exciting .
i believe barrie has written another peter pan book as well , a prequel of sorts entitled " peter pan in kensington gardens .
" it should be interesting , particuarly if it addresses what is contained in the dark dreams that haunt peter throughout this book .
freud would have a field day with such dreams and the whole mother issue .
the only thing i expected to see in this book that i did n't see was " happy thoughts .
" that must have been a creation of disney

having patronized boulevard all but twice , i still feel the need to write a review .
you have to understand that those of us " back east " think that california food is understated and so easy .
now not being a huge chef myself , but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef 's recipes ( my fave restaurants being of course , boulevard , and back east , 2941 , le tire bouchon , maestro , citronelle dc , galileo , inn at little washington , etc. ) .
i have no clue where i 'd get some of the ingredients in this cookbook , other than maybe the san francisco ferry building 's fabulous farmer 's market ( another real sf treat ! ) .
but to be real , we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients .
do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised .
now i was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and i have her handwriting -- just ingredients , no measurements .
and yes , i 've been able to improvise , and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of " recipes .
" but nothing is better than going to the restaurant .
cookbooks are fab and fun , but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals ( herselves ) are even more exciting .
buy this book even just for the photographs , as i 've never been in a more well-decorated and well-thought-out restaurant .
if only i did n't live on the east coast !

businesses can not exist without the it and vice-versa .
they are interdependent .
it systems automate the business processes and run 24 by 7 .
therefore we can not really view those who work at the " business " level as above us .
so , i disagree with the author on this point .
however , he does sort of make a u turn later on in the book .
this book will make you think .
for instance : what is the supply demand for programmers in a particular business domain ?
this would be a good question to research so that we can plan our career .
he talks about how to survive layoffs by being knowledgeable in different areas .
not everyone wants to stay in one organization for a long time .
another thing is that it is almost impractical to learn everything in a particular technology ( say , java technology ) .
developers will have different intentions , for example they might have a backup plan in case of it downturn , either by having a cash cushion or generating cash flow through software products .
i agree about following your passion .
it enables us to transcend limitations .
it inspires us and makes us reach a level of performance that amazes us .
this explains the previous paragraph ( which sounds like excuses ) .
another principle that he explains - " be the worst " is very real .
two projects , one early in my career where i had the opportunity to work with a strong and talented team of developers and project manager .
recently when i found working for people who were not anywhere near my capabilities , they did affect my performance .
this book helps to see and expect what the work environment could possibly bring us and what we can do to proactively handle these situations .
maintenance is seen as a menial work and recruiters downplay any experience on it .
oh , this is a developer job... chad advises you to learn to love maintenance .
he recommends having a mentor and i am glad i read his book .
i know mentors can also come in the form of a book ! ! !
you can have more than one mentor .
i love the eight-hour burn concept .
this explains why i get very depressed and productivity drops during the last few weeks of the project .
now i know how to make the work stay in the office .
no more nagging problems following me home !
the concept of " presence " is very realistic .
i learned this by making mistakes in the workplace and the cost was high .
i wish i had read this book early in my career .
lot of things that he explains has already happened to me in my career .
still i was able to learn how to handle those situations successfully next time around .
reading open source code really helps to solve recurring problems quickly .
i have experienced this in my job .
the cover of this book really needs to be improved .
the content of the book is much better than the quality of cover image

i have spent a lot of time and money researching into mormon history .
the big problem is that , as henry ford once said " history is bunk " .
with joseph smith and the history of the mormon church , there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many , an ingenious charlatan .
there are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide .
hence , using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of joseph smith can be a very frustrating ( and sometimes expensive ) exercise .
the church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony , but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony .
it is easy to see from my statement above , why .
this book takes a completely different approach in investigating the truthfulness of what joseph smith produced .
forget about what might have happened in the early 1800 's and instead , focus on the actual record contained in the book of mormon itself .
let current day investigation be the basis for the search of truth instead of historical personal accounts .
this removes any bias of the source material and hence allows for an objective study .
thomas stuart ferguson starts out as the book of mormon 's most enthusiastic proponent .
he sacrifices a large portion of his life both petitioning the first presidency for financial support , and performing extensive archaeological expeditions to find evidence of the civilisations documented in the book of mormon ( bofm ) .
while he expects an abundance of material to be discovered , he finds none .
nothing .
no evidence of the language or writings contained within the bofm , the animals and crops mentioned , artefacts , city names , weapons , metals , glass etc .
nothing for the period documented within the bofm ( 2500 bc - 400 ad ) .
there are few discoveries outside this timeline , but none within .
all he wanted ( and expected ) to find were actual artefacts or at least murals/pictorials showing the above documented items .
the turning point came when fragments of the joseph smith papyri were rediscovered in the late 1960 's and found to contain nothing in common with the book of abraham .
this is a completely separate quest in itself ( see " by his own hand upon papyrus " ) .
while ferguson may have lost his faith , he never left the lds church and continued to attend and support it - he even sent a son on a mission .
he believed the mormon church was " the best fraternity on earth " .
in public , he was a " normal " member , in private circles he believed joseph smith was a fraud and as a result , spent the remainder of his life researching why .
this book is both a document detailing ferguson 's quest for the truth , and his way of dealing with it from the result .

i call this one " frank peretti lite .
" it was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books .
instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare , this one had a creationist angle .
i really enjoyed it , just not the same as his other books .
also , you have to remember that this is fiction .
of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible .
but the central point about mutations comes through .

this book was originally conceived of and designed in the manner of an illuminated manuscript .
the images are combined with the text to convey meaning .
in the paperback most of the images are gone and the ones remaining are converted to black and white and shoved into the middle of the book where they lose their context

one reviewer of this book said he 's sick of investing tomes , they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors , who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients .
and of course those firms charge hefty fees , even if their timing is slightly off ( say , a few years or so ) .
another reviewer loved the book because he realizes he is going to have to work harder to invest successfully over coming years .
if only he had read the book in 1999 .
what is not fully understood by many investors is that the money game is run by wall streeters with whom you can not compete and beat over time .
some of the smartest people in the world work on the street and they are not sharing what they know with anybody .
but they want you in the game .
they need you .
they take care of their biggest clients ( and i mean really big ) and every client who is not big is late to the table and last to leave , usually at a loss .
because smaller clients start buying what the big players are just starting to sell .
which is why the big holders sell in dribs and drabs over time .
every winning trade requires a losing trade .
too bad , past results are no etc .
etc .
try to work the market independently against the big guns and you will eventually come to know the meaning of whipsaw .
and its consequences .
everybody thinks they can get out in time .
trouble is , when markets tank--stock market , real estate markets--there is no getting out because there are no buyers .
it 's a free fall without a parachute .
many real estate speculators will learn this in the coming year .
the author of this book , ed eastering , is well respected and can give you a good view of how the game works .
which is useful in a textbook kind of way .
and he attempts to lay out some tips for the solo investor .
trouble is , timing is everything and the information you need to time the market is not going to be found in any book .
or any proprietary system being peddled over the internet .
if it worked that well they would not be selling it to you .
so what 's the answer ?
contrarian investing ?
when everybody is long , go short , and vice versa ?
good idea but it requires a discipline that can tear apart the innards of a veteran wall street trader .
it is just not wired into the systems of most people to pull it off .
and reliable sell signals are about as hard to find as a legitimate 1918 inverted jenny .
another possibility : do what most of the really rich usually do , stuff it into long-term u.s. treasuries that pay a fixed interest rate and guarantee the principal at maturity .
of course , you have to keep them for the long term , which the really rich can afford to do .
can you ?
if not , you may sell the bond at a loss that negates the interest you were paid .
so you 're stuck with safe u.s. short-term notes which mature at par and pay the promised ( usually much lower ) interest rate .
not very exciting .
and if inflation pops your interest rate may give you breakeven or less .
well , that 's tough unless you had the cojones to buy one of the most volatile commodities in existence : gold .
this is a truly ferocious trap that has ruined many .
the big guns say do n't speculate with money you ca n't afford to lose .
hey , thanks .
that fits about .001 percent of the investing population .
read easterling for the historical big picture .
and it ai n't a pretty picture .
it 's all about volatility and volatility is a killer .
and so the moral of the story may be to be very careful with your investment decisions .
err on the side of caution .
the first consideration of the physician is do no harm .
the first consideration of the financial investor is lose not thy wad .
of couse there is the notion that markets investing is really just another excuse to excerise the gambling urge for people who consider casinos crass .
if that 's you , may luck truly be with you .

in the 1970 's , peter singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics ; animal liberation .
while some philosophers and others had in the past , argued for the necessity of being kind to animals ( schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for buddhism ) , peter singer was probably the first philosopher in western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals .
singer 's primary argument , and a very interesting one , is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals , particularly in the structures of our vital organs , nervous systems and brains .
singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering .
on these grounds singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights , at least when they are being used by humans .
the fact animals can suffer means we ca n't just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use , but we need to consider them as fellow beings .
singer builds up a set of arguments against eating animals , using animals in agricultural contexts , using animals for scientific experimentation , or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products .
singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge , including the use of 'rape racks ' and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments .
at the end of the book , singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example .
singer 's work has been very powerful in its influence , and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work .
however , others have criticized his arguments quite strongly , on many grounds .
it has also become a kind of manifesto for many animal rights campaigners and animal liberationists , some of whom have resorted to violent means to 'free ' animals from scientific experimentation .
while i admire singer 's rigorous arguments as well as the formidable evidence he marshals to back it , i can not entirely agree with them .
it seems that at least some scientific research involving animals is necessary for fighting many awful diseases and conditions which cause terrible human suffering .
i think a total ban on animal research , especially medical research and biotechnology research aimed at improving human health , is excessive .
animals also form an essential part of the livelihood of many people around the world .
no doubt in many cases some practices lead to animals suffering , but does this mean all useage of animals in agriculture should be stopped ?
where do we make changes ?
when do we make them ?
i certainly agree agriculture should be done in such a way animal cruelty is removed , and suffering reduced as much as possible , but preventing all suffering is impossible , and reality will require compromise .
also as another ecologist remarked , sometimes practices which cause harm to an individual animal is necessary to protect the overall ecosystem .
hunting rabbits and kangeroos or cats or horses will cause suffering to these creatures , but is often a necessity in australia where in many areas these animals are dangerous pests that ruin the native environment through overpopulation or hunting .
still , the strongest thing in favour of singer 's thesis is that we do share a profound connection with nature , and our terrible disregard for the biosphere is coming back to haunt us in the form of mass extinctions of species .
we certainly need to redevelop a sense of what edmund wilson calls 'biophilia ' , a sense of affinity with nature and the natural world , rather than simply seeing it as another object to gratify our desires

if you want to edit them then go be an editor .

i 'm a little late in reading this book .
i am trying to pace myself between the movies and the books so that i can enjoy a little harry potter at least every year .
i think goblet of fire is the best in the series , so naturally it would be pretty difficult for phoenix to live up to that standard .
in goblet , it feels like rowling had a fantastic ending in mind , and that drove the writing of the story .
in phoenix , it seems like the story is key and the ending was simply tacked on to round it out and provide some concluding information .
the major theme seemed to be the ministry 's takeover of hogwarts .
i found that entire thread to be thoroughly engrossing .
harry 's dreams , however , took on sub-plot status , and then rose to the top for the final conflict .
i did n't mind the length of the book , but it did seem to drag in a couple of places .
the gang spent too much time at grimmauld place .
i could have also done without hagrid 's giant story .
my biggest problem with the book was dumbledore 's secrecy .
good stories have real roadblocks to keep the hero from achieving his/her goal .
in phoenix , the cause for most of the confusion was that dumbledore was reluctant to share certain information with harry .
he explains his behavior in a most unconvincing way in the final pages .
the secrecy was necessary for the story to take the course that it did , but it lacked good motivation and left me feeling let down .
it reminded me of the natural disaster movie template where the world could be easily saved if not for an arrogant bureaucrat who refuses to listen to the young upstart with all the answers .
it is contrived conflict that is hardly believable .
do n't get me wrong .
i love the harry potter series .
and , perhaps my expectations have risen too high .
i am eagerly awaiting the movie and then i know i will devour book 6 ( when i allow myself to read it ) .
i lose interest in most book series after the first couple of installments .
harry potter always leaves me wanting more

after reading this account of the acension of everest , you got ta wonder why anybody would want to .
is it really worth it ?
for the thrill seaking personality , of course it is .
for normal people , forget about it .
even if you are n't into climbing mountains , this book is gripping from page to page and you do n't want to put it down .
krakauer 's first ( ?
) book - " into the wild " is also great but this one is better , being a first person account .
i remember when this came out and the surrounding backlash that accompanied it from people associated to the dead .
forget them , krakauer get 's it right , with no hidden agenda , unless you count surviving .
i would have liked more commentary from the surviving members , though .
and not to state the obvious to everyone else but me but why do they leave the bodies on the mountain ?
they risk their lives to rescue the affirmed or injured living but once they 're dead , they just leave them there ?
what 's up with that ?

there is about as much additional science in social intelligence , compared to emotional intelligence , as you could write on a postcard : mirror neurones and spindle cells .
nevertheless , we can be thankful that daniel goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way .
firstly , it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness , which is goodness .
secondly , it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format .
note that this already existed in emotional intelligence , but was not so clearly called out .
the most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fmri studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of inter-personal relationships to psychic ecology .
a question-mark would be against the reliance on seligman 's and csikszentmihalyi 's questionnaire based results .
questionnaire psychology is frustratingly limited in the gap between the suggestive nature of the results and the impossibilty of distinguishing between correlation and cause-effect

carl hiaasen , who pens a weekly column for the miami herald , certainly follows the adage " write what you know .
" while he occasionally covers nationally significant events , hiaasen generally confines his writings to the fertile territory that is the state of florida .
readers of hiaasen 's columns know well his passions and viewpoints .
his sarcastic commentaries often take aim at such topics as the medical profession , land developers , crooked politicians , gun aficionados , tobacco companies , madcap theme parks and the destruction of florida 's environment .
but weekly newspaper pieces are not the end of hiaasen 's caustic observations --- they are only the beginning .
in 10 novels written over a span of 20 years , hiaasen has expanded upon all of these topics in hilarious tales that poke fun at every aspect of life in the sunshine state .
nature girl is hiaasen 's 11th novel .
while he skewers many familiar targets , there are a few new objects of ridicule for his skillful and entertaining writing .
hiaasen 's florida romps all share common traits : quirky plots , countless screwball characters and an irreverent style that creates laughter on every page .
the prime target for his ire in nature girl is boyd shreave , a telemarketer pitching florida real estate who places a sales call to honey santana , thereby setting in motion a chain of events familiar to any hiaasen aficionado .
anyone who has experienced the pain of a telemarketing call interrupting a quiet and peaceful evening at home can identify with santana 's plot of revenge .
she turns the tables on shreave and lures the unsuspecting pitchman to florida for a phony tour of nonexistent florida property .
nature girl begins with an event not uncommon in a hiaasen novel : someone dies and someone else tries to dispose of the body .
sammy tigertail , a fugitive half-breed seminole , takes a tourist out on his airboat .
the tourist is frightened by a harmless water snake and dies of an apparent heart attack .
panic-stricken , sammy decides to ditch the body somewhere in the ten thousand islands area of southeast florida .
the cast of characters , as often occurs in a hiaasen novel , expands exponentially .
shreave has a wife intent on divorce , along with a girlfriend who accompanies shreave on his ostensible florida vacation .
eugenie fonda once achieved fame as the girlfriend of a tabloid murderer .
while santana is obsessed with her plot to destroy shreave , she must also fend off the advances of a stalker known only to readers as mr. piejack and her drug-running former husband perry .
add to the mix one florida state co-ed who falls in love with sammy tigertail and a private investigator hired by shreave 's wife to follow him on his tryst with eugenie , and the pieces to a puzzle that create a picture of hilarity are almost all in place .
carl hiaasen is a genius in creating mayhem on the pages of his novels .
characters move in all directions across florida , and readers may often have difficulty keeping track of their various escapades .
in the end , however , everything comes together in a typical hiaasen conclusion .
nature girl is pure hiaasen , and his many readers once again will experience the joy of his humor and his easily recognized and human characters .

excellent , realistic , practical advice .
as parent of a very strong-willed two-year old , i continually found myself in a power struggle with him over everything !
after reading this book in a couple of hours , i immediately began implementing the techniques ( which are very common sense and simple ) , and now , just a couple of months later , i have a totally different relationship with my little boy .
i no longer feel like i am controlling him all the time , he is happily independent in ways we are both comfortable with .
this book really changed my life .
btw , i had previously read the original love and logic for older children , which i liked , but it recommended spanking for children under 3 .
this did not help ! ! ! ! !
this book recommends no spanking , but withdrawing all attention empathetically , which is what my pediatrician recommended , which actually works

john tyree is a soldier first , a man second .
or so he thinks until he meets savannah lynn curtis .
while on leave , he falls desperately in love with savannah , the proverbial girl of his dreams .
sweet , intelligent , and giving , john knows he 'll always carry her torch .
when september 11 changes the world , john is no exception .
moved by patriotic loyalty , he chooses to " re-up " in the army , adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to savannah .
more promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father .
this is the story of how an ideal love can falter , despite its purity and strength .
not every romance results in a happy ending , but with a great deal of luck , those who do n't survive will find meaning from the experience .
love , loyalty , friendship--all those sentiments are great , but to what cost ?
and how does this make a good man great ?
this is john 's journey to that understanding .
it goes without saying that nicholas sparks is one of today 's " master " storytellers .
part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists .
such is the case in dear john .
sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components--well-crafted setting , high emotion , obstacles , resolution--then breaks it .
it is from the sadness that hope emerges , and john tyree , although still quite young , gains wisdom that will last a lifetime .
sorrow will be a large part of this , yes , but there is room for something more , something that will reach beyond the pages and touch john 's tomorrow in a way only he will see .
while this works , there is something lacking .
it is one of those hard-to-define qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding .
maybe it 's the heavy reliance on john 's soldiering as an excuse for certain behaviors .
or perhaps it has more to do with aspects relating to john 's relationship with his father , who appears to have asperger 's syndrome .
i 'm giving dear john 4-books for a beautiful story , but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper .

dale carnegie is one of the authors i have admired for so long .
there are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one .
he deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it .
of course , there are many negative people who do n't like this book because they see everything in black and white .
carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate , positive and humane approach to everyone around you .
it comes very close to " treat the others as you want them to treat you " .
i am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book , the world will be a better place .
i am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people .
some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important .
his viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex .
after all genius things are usually simple .
carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples .
i liked that the book is practical , easy and fun to read , and most of all that it delivers great value .
i can not say the same for many other books .
definitely get a copy especially if you are a " good " person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity

jared diamond has an ambitious goal : explain the history of mankind globally .
his thesis is quite simple : different people had different histories because of geographical ( environmental ) , not innate ( racial ) differences .
he presents , develops and defends his point of view brilliantly and forcefully .
some people remained hunters-gatherers , while others became masters of the world .
the crucial factor in human history is food .
the availability of materials ( plants , animals ) for domestication leads to the production of food surpluses in some geographical fertile regions , which allowed the feeding of specialists outside agriculture ( craftsmen , warriors , bureaucrats , priests , kings ) .
intensive food production , population size and societal complexity stimulated each other as fewer peasants were needed to feed the whole population .
craftsmen developed maritime , military and industrial technology and warriors conquered new territories .
population growth generated a centralized organization ( a state structure ) for decision making ( politics ) and conflict resolutions ( law ) .
domestication provided other cardinal advantages .
infectious diseases evolve from animal diseases .
through intimacy with animals people became immune .
but , when not immunized populations came in contact with immunized , they were wiped out .
also , animals could be used as power engines and warrior transport means .
other important historical factors were those related to transmission of acquired knowledge : migration and , cardinally , writing .
while hunter-gatherer groups remained more or less egalitarian , states with centralized governments generated great differences of wealth .
they became ruled by elite which controlled nearly wholly ( kleptocracy ) or partially the manna of the state ( the budget ) .
but , how could the elite continue to control the masses ?
jared diamond sees 4 different solutions : arm the elite and disarm the masses , redistribution of wealth , impose public order and curb violence ( police ) , construct ideology or religion to justify the kleptocracy .
the author remarks judiciously that with the organization of the state the irrational beliefs of the population became institutionalized into an ` official ' religion .
all in all , jared diamond 's book is a magisterial and very revealing darwinian essay about power problems and survival of the human species .
a must read for all those interested in the history of mankind .

a very solid and balanced recounting of the career in power of one of the most important diplomatic figures of the past one hundred years .
in his book , professor beisner wisely concentrates almost entirely on the twelve years dean acheson was in power in washington , d.c .
the great issues grappled with in the immediate years after world war ii still live with us today : russia , germany , vietnam , japan , north korea , israel , iran , france , and china/taiwan .
if you are curious to know why some things are the way they are in today 's world , read this book .
the number of key foreign policy challenges that flew at this talented secretary of state is astonishing

barrow , an astronomer at the university of sussex when this book was published , provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics .
do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics ?
what 'reality ' do mathematical entities like pi have ?
what accounts for what physicist eugene wigner has called , in a now-famous paper , &quot ; the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences&quot ; ( 299 ) ?
after an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers , barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism , inventionism , intuitionism , and platonism , a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor .
perhaps most mathematical workers follow what alfred korzybski called &quot ; the 'christian science ' school of mathematics , which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed ` scientific ' activities&quot ; ( science and sanity 748 ) .
i commend barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly .
barrow 's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations .
as for barrow 's conclusions , from a non-aristotelian view , the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification , the confusion of orders of abstracting .
barrow does n't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics .
he seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him .
as korzybski pointed out , we live in a world of multi-dimensional , ordered structures or relations .
it does not seem unreasonable , then , that we can map this world with an exact language of relations , i.e. , mathematics .
but as korzybski also pointed out many times , &quot ; the map is not the territory.&quot

this is one of those life changing books .
i first came across this while looking midlessly through my local " spiritual " bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours .
as a fast read , with a simple , concise message , this book lacks nothing .
it is n't dated , unless you consider religion or spiritual ideas dated .
richard bach creates a story that can effect you as much or as little as you want- but it teaches the precepts of becoming a messiah yourself and helps you to view jesus , christianity , god , and yourself in a brand new light .
needless to say , this is a five out of five .
buy it today and then give it away

this book was mind expanding , and told a great story of exploring the facets of one 's personality and how much that personality is interdependent with his wife and others .
my favorite part was the story of the " golden pages " where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man 's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery , but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm , if not war

i have been a fan of larry gonick ` s work for years ever since i first stumbled onto his cartoon guide to statistics .
he covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically .
innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line .
it was this historical approach that made carl sagan 's cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science .
i have long said that we teach science backward .
we still teach on a 19th century model .
we start with biology , then chemistry , and finally physics .
even when i was in high school , i wished that i could take physics before chemistry .
before i was elected as a school board director , i was on our district 's gifted advisory council .
i made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and , then , biology last .
i was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics .
so why not teach the math along with the science ?
integrate it .
( no , that would make it too relevant .
)

i felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a nobel laureate making the same assertion that i had been making for years-we teach science backwards .
after all , the toughest course out there is biochemistry-at least that is what every med student i know has ever said .
and biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster innovations-nano-technology not being the least of these frontiers .
gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first , because in this book on chemistry , he introduces quantum mechanics , which is normally taught as physics , on page 28 .
do n't let he word " cartoon " in larry gonick ` s books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved .
he makes each subject accessible while being entertaining , but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject .
so when i needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping , it took me about thirty seconds to find my book .
i went right to larry gonick

while some of the summaries are " dated , " they are still useful in communicating the basic action of the play to students and the very fact that they are " dated " allows the book to serve as an illustration of how interpretations of shakespeare 's plays have changed since the lambs ' time .
i recommend this book heartily .

there are many books on arm 's architecture or manual references .
so far , this book is the only book which concentrates on the firmware development side .
both assembly language and c are discussed , which is a relief for embedded/firmware engineers like me who like to combine both languages in a project .
the 15 chapters in the book are :
1- arm embedded systems
2- arm processor fundamentals
3- introduction to the arm instruction set
4- introduction to the thumb instruction set
5- efficient c programming
6- writing and optimizing arm assembly code
7- optimized primitives
8- digital signal processing
9- exception and interrupt handling
10- firmware
11- embedded operating systems
12- cache
13- memory protection units
14- memory management units
15- the future of the architecture
the strength of this book lies on the extensive examples on how to program arm effectively .
it is a nice guide for those who want to learn arm programming style

he covers his company 's history , challenges , problems and successes in an unvarnished , matter-of-fact style .

the characters are tom , a navy seal specializing is counter terroism home on medical leave visiting his uncle , and kally , a big-city doctor caring for her terminally ill father .
sounds like a typical match for a romance novel , but this novel is so much more than that .
kelly and tom have a past , but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past .
all four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others .
many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend .
i think i have yet another author to add to my favorite list .
this novel not only has a suspensful , gripping plot , but is packed with romance , and excitment on many levels .
most romance novels are only about two people with various cameo appearances by several others .
not so , with this one .
there are four different stories wrapped eloquently into one novel , and expertly blended to create the whole .
the reader is kept guessing and there are surprises around evey turn .
some are pleasant and some sad .
this is truly a moving tale on all levels .
you won 't be dissapointed

suzanne brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in .
the " mystery " portion of the story and the romance between jane and cosmo left a little to be desired .
i really did n't understand why jane had to have her alternative personality as mercedes and cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened seal persona .
these particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to jules and robin , who clearly stole the show in this book .
as a matter of fact , of the different plots and stories going on in this book , jules ' was the best .
it was not only very well-written and sweet , but even as a hetrosexual female , i could identify with jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him , happens to all of us , whether you are in a gay or straight relationship .
i am really hoping that jules either gets his own book , or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness .
i do share ms. brockmann 's opinion when it comes to differences in appearance , nationality , sexual orientation , etc .
and i really like how she includes this in her books .
as far as i 'm concerned love is love , no matter what and it 's portrayed beautifully here .
please ms. brockmann , do n't allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline , it 's a very good one

as a prospective college student , i have to tell you how much i appreciate students ' guide to colleges .
it combines many of the best features of the princeton review and fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness .
i also appreciate that it is without any trying-to-sound-hip blather because these are not editor-interjected profiles , they 're written by actual students .
this is a great compliment--i have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year , and this is the best guide to colleges among the many i 've seen .
i also just read the oberlin college profile in this book with an oberlin alum and relative .
she said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate oberlin portrayal she 's read in a guide .
among other things , she and i loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable-in-previous-guides questions like " what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour ?
" the guide 's honesty also impressed me , as the fiske guide lauded vassar 's " diversity , " for example , where students ' guide admits " although vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot , most students are actually wealthy and white .
" i am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from hampshire to harvard will find this book incredibly useful ! !

i would strongly recommend that anyone interested in this book read the review of this book by m. goldin on h- net.it is comprehensive and comes from someone who served in an armed forces combat unit during the second world war .
this book chronicles the negative and prejudiced attitudes held by various figures of the army throughout the past century .
these attitudes may have been important in effecting the lives of individual soldiers at the unit level .
they too may have had certain effect on overall u.s. policy in such matters as bombing the rail lines into auschwitz .
there were also efforts to influence negatively american attitudes towards the emerging jewish state in israel .
this is in a way a sad and yet important book to read .
it chronicles how that fundamental american ideal of equal treatment of the individual human being was violated by prejudice , and ignorance .

'a little history of the world ' is exactly what the title indicates .
gombrich takes the reader from the dawn of time to the mid-twentieth century .
gombrich covers cave men , great religious leaders , philosophers , and events over an incredible timeline .
i got this book for my eight year old son and i to read together .
there were certain chapters and topics which grapped his attention .
other chapters were a little over his head in regards to understanding the causes for certain events .
in particular , the chapters covering the inquisition and the causes that lead to the french revolution were a little difficult for him to truely understand .
this book is a great way to introduce a child to the wonderful stories that make up the world we live in .
it may also be a stepping stone to further reading on subjects that spark some interest

the original publication of _the lives of john lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria .
much of it emanated from yoko ono , who likened goldman 's book to " being punched in the face .
" yoko is a close friend of jann wenner of rolling stone magazine , which duly ran an article attempting to discredit goldman 's book .
some of lennon 's fans took this behavior in and assumed that _the lives of john lennon_ was forbidden ; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty .
now , however , the dust has settled , and _the lives of john lennon_ holds up beautifully .
each contention of goldman 's which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands .
remember the ridiculous panic over goldman 's portrait of lennon as a heavy drug user ?
that drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew lennon , including ono and lennon 's first wife , cynthia powell .
the same is true about goldman 's claims about lennon 's tendency towards violence ( a tendency lennon himself owned up to in his playboy interview ) .
and , while ono and others acted agitated over goldman 's depiction of lennon as bisexual , ono herself is found to have said she considered john lennon a " closet fag " in a 1981 interview .
( why , then , was ono so upset by the appearance of goldman 's book ?
because of what it reveals about her .
)

it will be clear to anyone who approaches goldman 's book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified .
_the lives of john lennon_ is not dishonest or flawed in any way .
a perusal at his " sources " section reveals his awesome thoroghness .
goldman bravely explored areas of lennon 's and ono 's lives that others shied away from out of deference to ono , a worshipful attitude towards lennon , and a reluctance to figure things out .
albert goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject .
_the lives of john lennon_ might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify lennon , but for those with genuine interest in lennon , it is indispensable .

many reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports .
i would agree as i have reporting experience with ms-access and crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly .
if you like learning in a step-by-step fashion right out of a book - this is the book !
the bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book .
while this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book .
for example , one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book .
i would agree with that .
i was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book .
if you want a better reference book try the wrox book , professional sql server 2005 reporting services .
that book is not as good as this book from a step-by-step standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions .
for example , page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows - they call it greenbar reports .
it was not easy to find in this book either .
how many people would look up " greenbar reports " in the reference ?
i was looking into " shading alternative rows " .
i just happened to stumble upon it .
i bought both books together .
of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at reporting services .
reporting services could use a cookbook-style text like they have for access and other programming languages .
those types of books have served me well over the years .
until then this book and the wrox book should do the trick

each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded .
the illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor , drawn in persian style .
the colors are very saturated .
the book 's cover gives you an idea of what they look like .
the message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities , races , ethnicities , languages or faiths , they still have the same hopes , dreams and daily needs .
this is a very important message for children to hear in today 's world where there is so much suspicion of those we " perceive " to be different .
the more children realize that kids are the same everywhere , the more tolerant they will be .
children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age , say researchers , so you have to nip it in the bud very early , and this book does that in a wonderful way .

i heard about this book from kelly and regis when they both raved about it on their talk show .
i bought it and i 'm as excited about it a they are .
it 's everything they promised and more -- and it 's actually fun to read which i never thought i 'd ever say about a &quot ; job&quot ; book

&quot ; stengel : his life and times&quot ; is no mere biography .
it is a chronicle , not only of the earlier days of baseball , but of america itself .
as a biography , it is superlative .
as a history book , it stands on it 's own merits

i agree with the other reviewers that the book is worth buying and excellent to give you new ideas for using crochet with knitting .
however , be warned that the sizing is fairly small .
all of the womens patterns are either size 36 inch or 40 inch finished measurements except for one pattern which is 40.5 inches .

angels was the smallest college in cambridge .
it was built at the beginning of the 15th century .
fairly had a fellowship .
st. angelicus students had to find their own lodgings .
fred fairly had taken the science tripos and received a first class degree .
he came from a rectory and so his material wants were limited .
he was used to making do .
at the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a christian .
fred knew the country was not a place of peace .
the rectory had been built in 1830 .
daisy saunders wanted to know how the human body worked and applied for nursing training .
she was seventeen and her mother had died recently and she was free to live away from home .
daisy , now known as saunders , was a probationer during her first year .
she was told to keep her eye on james elder , an attempted suicide via the thames .
it was january 1912 .
to all the patients , except for the dying , food was of paramount importance .
elder refused to eat .
the constable had said he was a gentleman .
he asked daisy if the incident had appeared in the press .
for arranging for a notice about elder 's conduct in the newpaper , daisy was dismissed .
fred fairly and daisy were in an accident with bicycles .
a good samaritan thought they were married to each other and put them to bed together in the spare room to regain their health .
fred was enchanted and afterwards he looked everywhere to locate daisy .
the kindness of the wrayburns , the samaritans , gave daisy a place to stay in cambridge .
she would do work in the house in exchange for room and board .
she had traveled to cambridge to find work in a private hospital .
happily daisy was employed at the mental hospital and fred found her again at the wrayburns' .
they went for a walk in the country .
fred asked daisy to marry him .
mr. wrayburn told daisy that fred could not be a junior fellow if he married .
in the trial , pertaining to the accident , the journalist , who had accompanied daisy to cambridge , was able to identify the man who drove the horse cart wildly causing the accident .
when the heart is broken , efficiency is impaired .
there was some suggestion in the testimony of the journalist that daisy had been or would have been used , but for the happening of the accident .
daisy had to leave the wrayburns and cambridge because of what was disclosed in court .
leaving her lodgings , she was free at last to cry over the hurt she had caused fred .
daisy and fred passed each other on her way to the train station .
we do not know what action , if any , resulted .
both of the young characters are portrayed as having beautiful consciences .
the writing is elegant .

i am a photographer and a writer and the author of numerous books on photography and i have had a copy of the sierra club engagement calendar on my desk every day for more than 20 years .
i find this calendar to be an inspiration in terms of both its beautiful photography and its wonderful geographic diversity .
i 've never had a photo published in the engagement book , but i 've probably gathered more inspiration and ideas from these little calendars than from the hundreds of how-to books in my office .
the photos in these engagement calendars are the cream of the cream of the crop of the world 's best nature photography .
master photographers like the late galen rowell , who had many dozens of photos published here , consider it one of their finest showcases--and who can blame them .
sierra club has never relented on the quality of the reproduction of these superb datebooks and considering there are more than 50 photos in each book , the price is a bargain .
i have used this calendar as a journal and a diary of my writing progress for , literally , decades .
and whenever my brain starts to freeze after writing about photography for weeks on end and i need a new idea to write about , i simply flip through the calendars and i can discover hundreds of them in the work of many of the greatest modern nature-photography masters .
also , when i 'm looking for travel ideas , places to go to shoot new pictures for my books , i also look here for inspiration and ideas .
the mojave desert , monument valley , the everglades , the sonoran desert--these are all places that i learned about in great detail from these datebooks .
you learn more about a place by seeing great photos of it than you ever will by reading about it--or so i feel .
( of course , you learn a great deal more if you hop on an plane and go see it !
)

finally , i gave my mother the engangement calendar for christmas every year for around 20 years and she used them as a daily journal .
i still have every one of those journals and they are a great joy to flip through and see what she was up to each day .
why this long winded ( and very sincere !
) endorsement for such a simple product ?
because i owe these caldendars ( and the sierra club ) a debt of gratitude for inspiring me day after day , year after year , with the greatest photography in the world .
if you have a young photographer in your life , inspire them , show them how spectacular photographs of the natural world can be .
for an investment of under $ 15 you can change their perceptions of nature and help educate them about fine photography .
someone gave me my first copy of this calendar many years ago and i 've been grateful ever since .
of course , i have to warn you , once you look at some of these photos you 'll want to put your camera up on ebay : ) but do n't do it !
instead , use these photos as your photographic inspiration and your goal .

my son had visited several colleges , and was having a terrible time figuring out which ones he would " fit in " and get the best educational experience from .
he ended up reading this book and visited a few of them that he liked the descriptions of .
after applying to , and getting accepted at , four of the schools in this book ( and two not in the book ) he ended up at denison university .
he 's in his second year , and just loves it .
i 've always felt a little " indebted " to this book , so i thought i 'd leave this review

i originally bought this for my almost-2-year-old because i wanted him to have a new alphabet book with both upper and lower case letters shown ( there are not many out there besides chicka chicka boom boom ) .
instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters .
the reason : this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter .
some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging .
it is a beautiful book that provides " i spy " and " where 's waldo " type challenges .
i highly recommend this book for the 1-5 crowd

a really great book by a great man .
i almost laughed out loud while on a train and am sure people thought i was crazy .
the book made me wonder how can you lead such an interesting life and yet win a nobel prize in physics ( i guess you can ) .
though the book does not follow a chronological order , i could feel the earlier part corresponds to the youthful times in his life ( if he ever got old ) .
towards the later stages in the book i could also sense some cynicism in his words and he feels strongly about the lack of integrity , particularly in scientific research and life in general around him .
a wonderful book that gives some insight into a brilliant mind and inspires to think while learning and not just memorize facts .

as a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text " mechanism and theory in organic chemistry " by lowry and richardson , this book by anslyn and dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student .
i agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging , the text is clearly written , and the material relates well back to current research issues .
if you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program , get this book before you try " advanced organic chemistry : structure and mechanisms " by carey and sundberg .
i expect that " modern physcial organic chemistry " will become a staple to most chemist 's shelves similar to that of a crc handbook or " advanced organic chemistry " by march .

line by line , this book has some of the best writing i 've seen in a while .
this is an amazing thing , since it 's still very fast-moving and not at all overwritten .
the author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor .
the book surprised me constantly with its insights , and these characters were so real to me by the end that i missed them for a week .
i read craig 's first book , and it does n't stand up to this at all .
it 's exciting to see how much the writer has improved , and i ca n't wait for the next one

if you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that 's loaded with wit , i 'd suggest picking up this book .
i never knew there were four kinds of people before : morons , fools , lunatics and cretins .
and i may just be a fool .

if you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics .
i started with once-a-month-cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary , but , though i loved it was a hard days work .
then came jill bond and she was really talking bulk cooking !
when deborah 's first book came out i was excited because it fit in with my low-on-cash , short-on-time lifestyle .
this book is terrific because it provides a healthy alternative that is still pretty inexpensive .
the meals are more than casserole and there are lots of options that are more appealing for the warmer weather when you do n't want to heat up the kitchen .
my favorites are the cheese and chicken shells ( not for everyone however ) chicken enchiladas ( taste great made with homemade whole-wheat tortilla , if you do that ) , crab rice chowder ( gourmet ) , bean casserole and everyone loves spaghetti pie .
there are lots of good recipes in this book .
the drawbacks of this book is that after a few initial sessions i felt that i was more likely to choose some favorites than to use her already laid out sessions...that is okay , but , not as easy as using the shopping lists and plans .
worth trying if you are serious about freezer cooking , but i would start with frozen assest first

i had eyed this book for quite some time before i purchased it , and i am so glad i did !
the pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book !
most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based , so do n't pick this book up looking for lots of kid-friendly drinks ( though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy , such as a s'mores hot chocolate ) .
the recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes .
order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty , piping hot drinks

this is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution , how it will wither away , and what a society should look like ( or try to mould itself into ) after the revolution .
lenin , drawing on the works of marx and engels extensively , refutes many claims by both the anarchists and opportunists on the role of the state , and corrects many common errors believed about the marxist road to socialism .
this is a thoroughly informative read .
i recommend those wondering how a communist society would emerge after a revolution to get this book ; it will open your eyes widely

this book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre .
it does the hard work of picking out a crucial 16-bar piece of a song for you !
great for auditions .
the book has selections from musicals ( old and new , familiar and rare ) , as well as movies ( even some disney ! ) .
there 's one for every vocal part .
granted , not every piece is exactly 16 bars .
some go a bit over , but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing .
it 's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out .
it 's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals

the big sky is not just a masterpiece , it 's probably the masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction .
this is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that is n't really dealt with that much - the rocky mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850 .
the cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature , partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us : the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in " cowboy " movies mirror our own experiences in many ways .
the cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to americans , when actually nothing was further from the truth .
cowboys were regular working stiffs , about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day .
they did n't consider themselves " free " , nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day .
they did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage , and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were , especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had .
but it was backbreaking work , and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years .
i said all that to say that " the big sky " really is about freedom , and really is about the west .
it 's about the true , wild , primitive west , before the plow , before roads , when there were still huge , intact indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo .
so it 's interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored , but i can see why - there are no set-piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no " new sherriff in town " characters , because there are no sherriffs , and no towns other than a few trading posts .
there is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those indians .
if you do n't already know , this is the story of boone caudill and his friend jim deakins , and several important side characters , but it 's basically boone 's book .
he 's driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom , and is pushed out by a brutal father .
he makes his way west to st. louis , along the way befriending deakins , in hopes of meeting his uncle zeb who had become a trapper years earlier .
the rest of the tail is complex and interlaced , and not a simplistic good guy/bad guy plot at all , and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all , arching like the sky itself , is freedom .
freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book .
freedom is the religion , the politics , the philosophy , the recreation - it is everything that is important .
the trappers are there to trap - sure - but they 're really there because this is a wild , free place , where they will not be hampered by rules , where they can be natural men .
it sounds over romanticized , but it really did happen that way , and from what we know , that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence .
despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns , boone cries " lord , jim - remember the tetons standing proud in the sun , and the seeds ke dee...do n't you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save injun ?
" this novel makes you sob like few i 've ever read .
the sense of loss , the closing of an age of the world , hangs in the air like mist .
they are going to be the last to see something so precious , and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement .
the movie " the mountain men " with charleton heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book , and you can tell it 's inspired in many ways by it , but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel .
" jeremiah johnson " is another good film , with many fine touches .
but if you want to follow the water up stream , back to its source in the mountains , then please , before you grow too old , read " the big sky " and open your heart to that time and place and the wild , brazen beauty of the america few americans know ever existed

this is a great compliment to the more project-based make magazine , as it focuses a little more on the personalities of the " makers .
" of course , it also describes ( and shows , in beautiful photographs ) , their projects , but it 's a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers , bored brainiacs , and fringe-worthy souls who are the heart of the newest form of the diy geek culture : creating incredible , real-world projects , from the mega ( a home built submarine for 3 ) to the micro , ( a diy bat detector ) , to the whimsical ( a lego blocks project that will solve the rubik 's cube ) .
if you 're a vociferous reader of slashdot , you may have seen some of these projects before , but the book really gets into the motivation behind them .
production values , writing , and design are superb , and of course , urls are provided so you can find out more on the makers ' sites .
bottom line , this fascinating survery of make culture ( and cool projects ) is a must for every geek 's coffee table , and it 's also a great way to introduce your mom into what it is you actually do with your spare time. .

my comments are not on the cev translation , but rather on this particular edition .
among all low cost editions of the whole bible ( protestant canon ) , this one is outstanding in three respects :
1 ) it has the most extensive annotations ( footnotes , introductions and outlines for each book of the bible , and study helps ) of any .
they are not as extensive as many full-fledged study bibles , of course , but it is a fraction of the price .
2 ) these annotations appear to have been designed to be solely descriptive , not reflecting any particular theological or scholarly bias .
thus , this edition can be used by persons with quite a wide range of theological orientations .
3 ) it has the largest print size .
( many low cost editions have rather small print .

if you have ever needed to change a part on your bike , upgrade to something better , change out your drivetrain , tune your derailleur 's , or even true a wheel... this is the book for you !
with awesome in depth pictures , and step by step technical procedures for doing just about anything to the bike that you so dearly love .
john barnett 's experience with bike repairs far surpasses that of the guy that you normally bring it into for those expensive repairs , so spend the money for the book , and save money in the future while at the same time learning from one of the top professionals in his business !
do it , it 's an awesome book

i thought this was an excellent book .
those who say this wo n't turn you into a champion overnight , i 've got news for you - no book can do that .
only you can...i 've raced ( retired now ) for most of my adult life including some pro races , some of my crew have gone onto champ cars , nascar , and f1 , i was lucky enough to be associated with a team that won the champ car title and my engineer was from that team .
this book gives excellent information and if you can read between the lines you will learn quite a bit that can help you in your racing career .
those who ca n't learn anything from this book are advanced enough they do n't need to buy any books , but most of us do n't have last names like andretti , senna , unser , etc .
if any of you have ever read senna 's book on driving you might also say it 's nothing special but you need to read between the lines and figure out what he is alluding to , not what he writes directly about .
few people will directly give you the " secrets " to motorsports

peter watson , holding a number of research degrees , offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the 20th century in this book .
not being an easy read , it takes some time to get through .
the main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the 20th century in its economic and social context .
this is quite an achievement , considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics .
watson tends to cover science the best , and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of 20th century science , including the theories of relativity , quantum mechanics , scientific cosmology , evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene .
however , the book falls down in some parts where it covers philosophy .
watson dismisses husserl 's phenomenology as 'abstract ' and of little importance , when in fact phenomenology was probably the most important philosophical school in the 20th century along with analytical philosophy , founded by russell and wittgeinstein , and attracted so many leading european minds to philosophy in a time when science was at its zenith of glory .
overall though , watson 's work is a very important attempt to see where we are in what we know , and where we are going .

having worked with vbscript for a little over four years i am by no means an expert ; however , i feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting .
i was pretty skeptical when i saw the word " advanced " in the title , but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters .
the book begins with securing ( including digital certs and policies ) and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in wmi and adsi .
for me personally , the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with wsf and wsc files .
don and jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind xml functionality as well as it 's application within the scripted files .
these guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies .
they wrap up the package peice with explanations around hta 's and form controls in html scripts .
the book moves on to cover topics such as adsi and ado scripting , working with wshcontroller and remote scripts , wmi and wql classes and techniques , and different applicable real world examples .
all this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug , sign , and package your scripts as well the wizards ( wmi , adsi , wsf , etc ) and other tools available to make scripting easier .
i 've obtained quite a few vbscript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced vbscripting .
if you are new to scripting with vbscript , you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods , properties , classes , etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use .
while this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics , you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it .
thumbs up !
highly recommended bang for the buck

rather than reading a biography of red auerbach , wilt chamberlain and bill russell , turn to this period book !
here you get everything : a complete portrayal of the situation of african american who were just starting to segregate professional sports outside of the brooklyn dodgers .
but at the same time it is an introduction to a time , when athletes were not the superstars of today .
on top of that , you get enough biographcal information on russell and chamberlain , but also on cousy , auerbach and many others .
the book is very well written and starts right with information , no tedious introduction to plough through

_the new taste of chocolate_ has the beautiful pictures of a coffee table book , but it has a lot of academic substance and a lot of value to the reader .
the main chapters are :
- growing up with cacao
- a natural and cultural history of chocolate
- from cacao to chocolate
- identifying cacao
- tasting chocolate
- recipes

there is also a glossary , and a list of companies to order fine chocolate from .
for a beginner like myself , who loved chocolate but had n't progressed much beyond hershey 's with almonds when i read the book , _the new taste of chocolate_ was very educational .
it explained the path from cacao bean to chocolate bar , and it also explained the difference between dark chocolate , milk chocolate and white chocolate .
it explained how cocoa powder comes from chocolate , why chocolate is so difficult to make candy with if you do n't know what you 're doing , and why fancier recipes will sometimes specify chocolate manufacturer and cacao percentage .
it was also quite interesting to read about the guidelines for tasting chocolate .
the discussion about criollo , forastero , and trinitario cacao plants was very fascinating from a scientific standpoint .
i later found that what is true for cacao trees is true for many other types of plants ( including wheat ) : the plants that make the tastiest & highest quality edible parts are also the least productive and most delicate , so growers & breeders have to choose whether to grow something that will almost certainly produce a less-desired but still profitable crop , or to grow something that has an uncertain yield but is highly profitable should the plant actually produce anything .
the recipes were also interesting .
after reading this book , i became more adventurous in my chocolate-tasting and started trying some of the european imports i see in the local grocery stores .
my only regret is i am now knowledgeable enough and my tastes are spoiled enough that m&ms and hersheys with almonds seem pretty bland

this book has a photo of each dessert so you can see what you 're making and easy recipes that look impressive , all using a cake mix box of some kind .
their snickerdoodle cake uses a white cake mix , some other ingredients , and includes a cinnamon buttercream frosting recipe .
yum !
i love the variety of recipes ( bundts , bars , round , layered , etc .
) and my kids and i can do many together .
i think the packaged cake mixes from the store have a nice taste , so these recipes just build on those mixes .
i just want easy recipes that are n't intimidating , and this book is the solution for that .
i highly reccommend the cake mix doctor .

this was a childhood favorite of mine which i frequently read in the library of the troy jewish community center 87 first street .
i can remember sitting there and reading about such questionable greats as harry danning , sid gordon and moe berg .
of course there were undoubted greats like hank greenberg and sid luckman .
and there was in boxing too barney ross and benny leonard .
perhaps there are more up- to- date books about jews in sports but i doubt there are any which tell a story as well , and give the young person such a warm feeling about the jewish contribution to what seemed at that time of life , the most important form of human activity .

we love this book - mom and two year old included !
gerald the giraffe finds music that he loves and is able to dance like never before .
fun text , colorful illustrations .
this is a book we have read over and over in our house .
has a great message about finding the music that works for you .
i love it so much i bought a copy for our niece !

if one approaches this book with a view to learning music theory , one would be slightly disappointed .
the author brushes right through the fundamentals but that is to be expected from an outline book of this type .
all in all , i think this book will come in useful after i 've learned music and need to review theory from time to time .
great book though

i 'm a fan of bill myers work and have been since " blood of heaven " .
this one slipped by me somehow and when i saw it i immediately got it .
while the plot is somewhat tight for the most part , i do have some problems with parts of it .
for one thing , the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him ( read the book to find out ) should n't have any qualms about killing millions of others .
so why is he so intent on the stones ?
but the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old .
the minute anything happens , they 're all screaming each other 's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it .
for the first-time emergency , we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters , you 've got to have a break !
" daniel !
" " tyler !
" " helen !
" " tyler !
" " daniel !
" " dad !
" " helen !
" " tyler !
" give me a break !
otherwise , a good story...though not up to the same level as " threshold " or " blood of heaven " ( definitely better than " eli " though ) .

the quality of this presentation is far above what one normally sees in &quot ; game&quot ; cookbooks .
lots of color pictures ; all recipes tried so far are keepers .
btw : elk substitutes straight across in most of the recipes so its like two books in one

if you want great mathematical puzzles , you buy a terry stickels puzzle book .
if you want to read about the universe from the world 's best amateur mathematician and physicist , you read martin gardner .
if you want a professional 's point of view of all the above , you read anything by ian stewart .
this is simply a must read for all clear thinking people

this book gives very good advice about managing behavior problems in difficult children .
however , the concept of a " strong-willed child " is confusing because it implies a child with will power or self control .
these difficult children actually have poor will power and self control .
the techniques given in this book will help teach such children self control .
it is important to understand that the cause of the strong-willed child is an excessive drive for power over others .
the strong willed child wants to be captain and he wants everyone else including his parents to be a deck hand .
parenting this type of child correctly , will help him learn to better control himself and respect others .
however , he will likely never be the compliant child that some parents are hoping for .

i 'm not the expert fencer i long to be ( yet ) , but i do have an ever-growing collection of swords , mostly gifts from grateful spanish patrons , but i 've also been able to purchase and acquire blades from several countries .
the pride of my collection is a fairly well-preserved roman sword from the reign of trajan .
burton was , as we all know , something of a dabbler .
in this book , he offers us not only straight history of the sword , but also countless fascinating bits of sword lore .
i quite frankly ca n't imagine any sword lover being without this book .
i am looking for a first edition , but for now , this reprint is a valued part of my library

joe pickett 's daily life is not as enjoyable as it once was .
his wife now has a successful business and brings home a lot more money than he does , and there 's still the temptations both of them thought about while joe was away at jackson hanging over their marriage .
his relationship with his fast growing up daughter sheridan is not what it once was and his new boss is doing everything he can to make joe 's life a misery .
throw in a civil war between saddlestring 's largest family and the appearance of , after along term behind bars bloodthirsty j. w. keeley , who will not stop at anything until he has avenged his daughter 's ( joe 's stepdaughter 's ) death through the slow and torturous murder of joe pickett , and one way or another the era of saddlestring 's game warden is set to end .
c.j .
box 's joe pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel .
the initial open season was a surreal not quite but almost carl hiaasen type novel , then savage run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure .
trophy hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and as many , i was glad when out of range returned this series to the traditional believable realistic type thriller , a style which continues with in plain sight .
i would strongly suggest reading these books in order , starting with open season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and in plain sight is certainly no exception to that .
it will be interesting to see if c.j .
box continues with the characters of this series in some form or another or if his next book will be a totally different kind of adventure .

</review_text>
<review_text>

in plain sight offers an exceedingly thin plot and thin characters , but it is still an enjoyable read owin entirely to author c. j .
box 's prowess at telling a story .
saddlestring , wyoming is enjoying the dawning of spring and , unsuprisingly for a police procedural , a possible murder .
opal scarlett , the grand and really mean old lady of thunderhead ranches , has disappeared and perhaps has been the victim of foul play .
tom wayman , an alcoholic fishing guide , is brought in as a suspect .
opal , in violation of the law , charged wayman and other boaters a fee for navigating the river that runs through her land .
she strung up razor wire across the river and the lazy sheriff thinks a drunken wayman killed her when he tossed her into the river .
frankly , there 's not a lot of excitement here .
joe pickett , wyoming game warden , is dealing with a problematic new boss and his 14 year old daughter , sheridan .
sheridan just happens to be the best friend of jule scarlett , daughter of hank scarlett , one of two brothers who might be heir to the big ranch .
of course , they ca n't find a will and the two brothers are smashing each other with shovels when joe arrives to drop off julie .
julie , it turns out , does n't live with her father hank .
no , she lives with opal 's eldest son , arlen , on his " side " of the ranch .
there 's a third brother , wyatt , who is a bit on the weird side .
the very weird side .
enter j. w. keely , a good old boy , who is on the run from mississippi where he has murdered a couple .
on his way to wyoming to settle a personal vendetta against joe pickett , keely murders a prisoner and then guns down a cowboy who did nothing more than get keely angry .
again , not much here .
keely is not a convincing bad guy ; more like a typed out description of a " bad " guy .
under the name of bill monroe ( which author box reminds us several times is also the name of a famous country and western musician ) goes to work for both of the arlen brothers .
golly gee : several nasty things happen at the pickett household .
oh my , the fbi keeps inquiring into the whereabouts of nate romanski ( or something close to that spelling ) who apparently figured largely in a previous novel .
all this produces tension in the pickett household , high job stress , arguments with best friends .
yawn .
just not a lot of excitement here either .
finally comes the climax .
rain .
thunder .
floods .
pickett 's daughers kidnapped !
the truth comes out !
box tries for a surprise ending , but it 's kind of like a wet firecracker .
all that said , " in plain sight " is still an enjoyable , if not particularly suspenseful , read .
he has a strong writing style and does a nice job of weaving in a feel for wyoming 's people that is , in my opinion , stronger than the underlying story .
this is the sixth of the joe pickett novels .
i wo n't be going out of my way to read the older ones , but i will keep an eye out for anything new by box .
he 's definitely a comer even if he has n't arrived .

growing one 's herbs is satisfying but using them completes the cycle .
if you 've ever wondered what to do with all the herbs you 've managed to put in your garden over the years this book can help you .
if you are just starting out with herbs this book can get you going properly .
not only does it have recipes but it has some ideas that i never could have imagined let alone used .
the bulk of the book is dedicated to the herbal index which is extremely helpful .
each illustrated herb is broken down and expalined simply as to it 's use , from root to leaves .
the only problem i found with this section is that it is organized by their botanical names , which unless you 're so inclined is difficult to find quickly .
this is a minor problem that is remedied by the oversized common name , which of course is not alphabetized but more recognizable .
a page is dedicated to over 100 of the most common herbs used .
it tells you how to cultivate the individual herb and it 's uses , which includes the medicinal use .
even if i do n't use all the herbs or have them growing in my garden it is fascinating to know the historical and contemporary use of herbs .
this book is a constant learning experience that can be read over and over .
a perfect garden companion for that break under a tree .
the knowledge can prove to be invaluable .
even such common herbs as thyme can present posssibly new insights into it 's benefits .
have trouble sleeping ?
the leaves of thyme can help insomnia as well as stimulate the production of white corpusules to resist infection amongst it 's many other attributes .
there is much more information than i need here but there is something for everyone , from herbal dyes , to baths and massages and to the ever popular potpourri .
this is , as the title suggests , the complete book on herbs .
a great book for the kichen or to help you plan your herb garden , this book has as many uses as the author presents uses for the herbs

histoire et collections has done it again.a fine work of the quality which the collector and researcher has come to expect from this publisher .
i have previous works on the british tommy in nw europe and canadian soldiers .
all are elaborately illustrated with charts , individual item photos , and reconstructions worn by models of combinations of equipment and clothing as qoen in northern europe .
in addition there are many lists , charts , and tables gathering together informatioon gleaned from many scarce and obscure publications .
muxh of rhia work has appeared in the excellent french language periodical militaria published also by histoire et collections .
this method of proceeding has the great virtue of first publishing in a more temporary format and inviting the readers to submit corrections and additional data which can be used to improve the final work published in book form

i love to browse through different cookbooks .
i have quite a collection , and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before i decide to purchase the entire book .
i normally look for 3 things in a cookbook , besides delicious recipes that will work for my family .
this includes :
1 ) pictures of more than 3/4 of the recipes ( color pictures are the best )
2 ) a spiral binding , or at least one that easily lays flat
3 ) new & innovative recipes that have ingredients i can easily find at a grocery store

i also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium , fat content , protein , fiber , and carbohydrates .
i picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal in-between working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events .
let 's face it , eating out is n't always the best for you , especially since you can not always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting .
i wanted some new recipes to try , but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying " what is it ? " .
i was not disappointed .
the book offered many beautiful color photographs , and the pages themselves were glossy and thick...not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use .
all of the nutrient information was included , along with a column called " nutrient bonus " that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of vitamin c , calcium , etc .
the book was hard cover , but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat , another good bonus so that i was not always struggling to keep my page open .
it also contains a rather large vegetarian section .
some of our favorites include : seafood salad with citrus vinaigrette , bistro beef salad , vietnamese style beef & noodle broth , mock risotto , chicken stuffed with golden onions & fontina , almond crusted chicken fingers , beer-battered tilapia with mango salsa , and loaded twice baked potatoes .
enjoy !

trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger , sex and death- revolutionary marxism , which was the driving force behind his life and work , mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger .
that observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the marxist tradition .
however , as trotsky demonstrates here , marxist methodology can not and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle .
here trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development .
in a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged .
if the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality , in a sense , it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production .
what marxism aimed for , and trotsky defends here , is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish .
that is the thought that underpins trotsky 's work here as he analyzes various trends in russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the october revolution of 1917 .
in short , marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness .
you will find no deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here .
quite the contrary .
here trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected ( or not affected ) by the october revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends .
mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends .
he analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature , like futurism and constructivism , and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive .
the most important and lasting polemic which trotsky raised here , however , was the fight against the proponents of ` proletarian culture' .
the argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the soviet union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement ( read a monopoly on the literary front ) .
trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that , in theory at least as its turned out , the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting ` proletarian culture ' would have time to develop .
although history did not turn out to prove trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development .
one of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals , particularly western intellectuals , based some of their sympathy for trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write .
this was particularly true during the 1930 's here in america where those who were anti-stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the socialist party were drawn to him .
a few , like james t. farrell ( studs lonigan trilogy ) , did this mostly honorably .
most , like dwight macdonald and sidney hooks , etc .
did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-communism .
such is the nature of the political struggle .
a note for the politically- inclined who read this book .
trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of lenin 's death and later while the struggle for succession by stalin , zinoviev and kamenev was in full swing .
while trotsky did not recognize it until later ( nor did others , for that matter ) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution .
hereafter , the people who ruled the soviet union , the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically .
in short , thermidor in the classical french revolutionary expression was victorious .
given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time .

dr. alex delaware is completely incorrigible !
i love this character , but no wonder his pal milo is going gray - keeping alex out of trouble is a full time job !
there is a scene in this one where milo tells alex straight out not to go snooping - he tells him , " i know you ... " yeah , milo knows him all right , and so do we , do n't we ?
( and if you do n't - read the books !
they 're great !
)

okay , alex is a clinical psychologist who is semi-retired , does mostly forensic work now for the court and the police .
his best friend milo sturgis is a homicide detective with the lapd .
once alex gets involved in a mystery , he is incapable of letting it go .
in all fairness , it is milo who gets him involved in this one .
alex and his girlfriend robin are rebuilding their house - she 's a carpenter , so she 's very hands-on with the rebuilding .
in the meantime , they 're living on the beach in malibu .
sweet .
milo is quite taken by one of the jurors involved in a particularly gruesome and high profile case .
ever since the trial , lucy lowell has been having nightmares and milo asks his friend alex to try to help her .
she 's quite a character and alex is taken by her too .
( things get a little complicated when she reveals her crush on milo - finally !
a woman falls for milo !
( i 'm not the only one !
) the fact he 's gay does put a crimp in things , but no matter ) .
while her recurring dream becomes more intense , other strange happenings have her - and everyone else - questioning her sanity .
but there is obviously more going on than anyone originally thought and alex is afraid maybe this dream is not a nightmare at all , but a long suppressed childhood memory .
the memory of a murder .
milo is tied up with another complicated case , so alex goes off digging on his own - again .
i had to laugh - several times , alex comments about doing something " on impulse " and i 'm sitting there waiting for someone to try to kill him .
the lies come so easy for him in this one - he 's been getting a lot of practice .
he pretends to be a journalist , a freelance novelist , a publisher and he even manages to keep his lies straight - he 's amazing !
but the inevitable happens and he and lucy find themselves staring down the wrong end of a gun .
the mystery is 20 years old , so it 's a very cold trail and a very complicated case - you wo n't figure it out - the ending is quite a surprise

" gpu gems 2 " edited by matt pharr ( addison-wesley , 2005 , isbn 0-321-33559-7 ) is a collection of forty-eight white papers that detail cutting edge techniques based on today 's latest graphical processing units ( gpu ) .
the full color hardcover text is 784 pages and includes a cd-rom with working demos and source for some of the articles presented in the book .
the text retails for $ 59.99 .
the book is divided into six parts : geometric complexity , shading , high-quality rendering , general purpose computation on the gpu , image oriented computing , and numerical algorithms .
a part has anywhere from five to twelve chapters .
each chapter is written by a different author but the format and style is consistent .
the chapters have an introduction , discussion of the problem or technique , conclusion , and references .
the material is presented with color illustrations and occasionally some pseudo-code or code fragments .
generally , the material is extremely current and very approachable to read .
as a sequel to its well received predecessor , the text focuses on taking advantage of the computational power and features of today 's high-powered gpu boards .
the first part of the book , geometric complexity , emphasizes this with chapters dedicated to batch rendering , using multi-streaming , hardware occlusion , and displacement pixel-shaders .
each chapter illustrates how operations traditionally performed on the cpu can be moved into the gpu for efficiency and greater effect .
the subsequent two parts on shading and rendering continue along the same theme : improved performance by using hardware functionality found on the gpu .
each topic considers the performance ramifications and gpu capabilities when discussing the problem domain of a rendering technique and factors it into the final solution .
for example , chapter 10 considers irradiance environment maps for fast lighting - but with a twist - using the gpu to do the calculations in real-time .
in doing so , the book 's real value becomes apparent .
the fourth part on general purpose gpu computation is an interesting addition to the text .
the chapters illustrate methods of offloading traditional cpu tasks by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of modern gpu hardware .
since the book features nvidia hardware , the architecture and performance capabilities largely focused on their products .
in the fifth part of the book , hardware assisted image creation and analysis is considered .
by using context clues from the spatial , texture , or lighting data - additional refinements can be made to a scene prior to rasterization .
the topics presented in this part are further refinements of the text 's main theme ( using the gpu fully ) and are specific solutions to uncommon problems - or approaches to rasterization .
none the less as gpus continue to evolve , the topics presented in this section will undoubtedly become more common .
finally , the sixth part of the book provides several non-traditional graphics examples to illustrate calculating data on the gpu : solving linear equations , options pricing , and numerical simulation - just to name a few .
as using the raw floating point power of modern gpu is a growing trend - these sections were quite interesting and well done .
the included cd-rom contains examples to 28 of the 48 articles in the book .
in most cases , the example material includes source code as well as pre-compiled binaries to help illustrate the topic presented in the text .
in order to run the majority of the samples , cg must be installed on the host computer .
in addition , the cd-rom provides access to nvidia 's software development kit , cg toolkit , performance tools , and several helpful reference links to on-line sites .
gpu gems 2 provides a cutting edge view of the capabilities found in today 's video cards .
the selected articles illustrate that every part of the rendering process can be enhanced in some fashion by fully using the underlying hardware .
as such , this book is essential to anyone working with modern gpus .

not great , maybe , but good .
the theme is vampire - the creatures that feed by night on their human cattle .
but what if the night goes on and on ?
good suspense , good characters and development , and an artistic style that carries the mood .
it 's a nightmarish visual style and a limited palette ( black , white , and blood red ) , but it works .
recommended .

john little and peter sisco wrote static contraction... but john takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight training/ muscle building.. my girlfriend and i started doing this method in may of 2005 and i can honestly say i 've never found such a fast , quick and easy way to build muscle .
this is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym... after a while , you only need to workout once a week... but do n't forget to stretch afterwards... and do n't forget to do cardio on other days .
i 've never been able to develop the 6pack abs until i used the techniques in this book... not to mention all the other muscles popping out that i never knew were there before !
i do n't entirely agree with his take on supplements - although i think he 's referring to all the stupid gimmicks out there designed to waste your time and money .
apparently he 's not familiar with shaklee

ed hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it does n't do justice to the man himself .
his dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them .
having shared some of his adventures but as a cop,i found that he loves cops .
if it was n't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one .
his book covers his life and gives a glimpse into the man and his style .
he does n't know how to go at half speed and neither does the book .
his upfront approach is evident .
he just does n't have time for b.s .
it 's a quick read and an enjoyable one .
make sure that you take it with you on vacation !
it will make it more enjoyable

v. i. lenin wrote this book in 1917 , while he was hiding from the russian government .
lenin pointed out that " the question of the relation of the state to the social revolution , and of the social revolution to the state , like the question of revolution generally , was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the second international ( 1889-1914 ) " .
he wanted to correct that oversight , and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book .
" the state and revolution " is a very short book , well structured and not difficult to read at all .
initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters , but lenin did n't conclude the seventh , due to the outbreak of the russian revolution .
in the postscript to the first edition he explains that , saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time , but that all the same " it is more pleasant and useful to go through the ` experience of revolution ' than to write about it " .
the main idea in " the state and revolution " is that the state is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms , and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class ( a " special coercive force " that rules through violence ) .
the state of the bourgeoisie will disappear , but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat .
the proletariat ( the working class ) will become then the ruling class , " capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie , and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system .
the proletariat needs state power , a centralized organization of force , an organization of violence , both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population -the peasants , the petty bourgeoisie , and semi-proletarians- in the work of organizing a socialist economy .
"

the dictatorship of the proletariat will be only a first stage in the path to communism ( " then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase , and with it to the complete withering away of the state " ) .
according to lenin , the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with the idea of the necessity of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of marx and engels .
all throughout this book , lenin cites and examines marx and engels ' writings , in order to explain and support his own point of view .
the importance of marxism for nowadays world has diminished enormously , but i advice you to read this book nonetheless .
it is certainly not a grueling task , and it will allow you to understand better some notions that many marxist leaders believed with all their hearts .
ideas drive men , and men make history .
" the state and revolution " will help you to get acquainted with some of those ideas , and that is not a small feat .

i am an experienced java programmer .
this book together with the netbeans ide allowed me to come up with a j2me application in less than a week .
the examples in the book is a great resource for learning to write j2me applications .
i learn best when i 'm coding .
in my case , i used the source from the peekandpick rss reader to come up with my j2me text reader .
the program has been heavily modified since , but the book provided sample code that was a great starting point for my learning .

wow !
this is a wonderful reference book not only for taiji jian ( tai chi sword ) , but also for taiji quan .
all sections of the book are straight forward and easy to follow .
there was n't any mystical &quot ; mumbo jumbo&quot ; i could n't comprehend .
the first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the taiji jian , i particlularly liked this historical information .
chapter two is for taiji jian and tai chi quan practitioners .
this chapter explains clearly the &quot ; ins and outs&quot ; of taiji quan and taiji jian .
the author explains basic trainning , principles , elements , etc .
i found this section of great interest to me having only studied taiji quan for about a year now .
i believe the information i 've gainned from reading this section will help improve my practice.i think advanced practitioners will find chapter two valuable as well .
the remaining chapters 3-8 give the reader information on the parts of the jian , how to practce with the jian , basic movements,fighting principles , and a 32 posture form with pictures and detailed explanations .
the explaination of each picture includes info about the key points , internal components and the movement itself .
this is a great manual that i know i will refer to over and over again .
this is a must read book for any taiji quan or taiji jian practitioner

the hellion bride is the second book in bride series .
i love ryder and sophie and the joy of meeting other characters from the sherbrooke bride .
i kept turning the pages to find out their secrets .
deceptive and abusive uncle theo as well as murder scenes make the story more thrilling and a suspense .
the virgin bride also comes in handy and she is an angel rather than a ghost for she always is encouraging and very nice .
sinjun pleasantly spices up the whole story .
i ca n't wait any longer to read her own story the heiress bride

this book is the best book on rand 's esthetics i 've ever read ; in fact , it is the only book on the topic that i know of .
it is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical ; they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by rand .
they approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing rand 's work in the larger history of esthetic theory .
they demolish abstract art , and devote considerable energy to discussing rand 's definition of art .
they even propose their own individual alternatives !
if anything shows independence , it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work !
remarkable !
the world of rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship .
that is clear just by reading one of the reviews here , by people who are devotees of certain &quot ; scholars&quot ; who do nothing but repeat the catechism .
they take swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published ; that is why they hate this book .
because it is independent-minded .
judge for yourself .
do n't be fooled

&quot ; good sports&quot ; is a book which helps girls to be the &quot ; best athlete you can be.&quot ; it catagorizes players , parents , and other important people into real-life situations .
it has quizes , quotes from other athletes , and memory pages .
also , it offers a lot of web sites and other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports .
more importantly , this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is all about .
one of my favorite parts in the book says : &quot ; sometimes heart is the strongest muscle.&quot ; this book also tells girls how to take good care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete .
it includes the food pyramid and what one serving is .
&quot ; good sports&quot ; involves &quot ; power drills&quot ; and advice from other girls .
it goes inside the lives of other athletes , such as michelle kwan , but also shows girls'lives who are teens or pre-teens .
this book not only focuses on the physical parts of playing a game , but on the mental part as well : keeping your dreams alive even when you 're at the bottom of the team , or you were embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped .
i would reccommend &quot ; good sports&quot ; to any female athelete , whether you are experienced or have n't even started yet .
it teaches you the basics and also the mental parts of a game !
it has advice on keeping your mind and body strong , along with being a good winner and loser .
it has advice from other athletes , famous or otherwise , memory pages to record your victories , dreams and goals , and ways to reach sports associations .
as the book says , it includes &quot ; winning .
losing .
and everything in between.&quot

barbara ghazarian 's book is a wonderful collection of recipes that originated in an ancient culture .
i enjoyed reading about her family and how armenian food remains a large part of the communal family experience .
these foods from the mediterranean region are exciting , flavorful , and easy to make .
barbara 's emphasis on bulgur wheat -- a staple in the armenian diet -- is particularly important , as this whole grain product has stood the test of time .
it might even be considered the gold standard of healthy , easy-to-prepare grains .
simply armeniangives americans a way to incorporate whole grains , meats , and vegetables into a healthy meal that a family can share .
while i read the book , a line kept running through my head : " our grandmothers were right .
" they cooked with simple , whole foods that provided excellent nutrition and variety from recipes that were handed down from mother to daughter .
simply armenianallows us to cook like our grandmothers and provide the same healthy choices for our modern families

this is a sci-fi novel about the end of the world .
every single adult on the planet died .
there are a couple of kids living in a house alone .
so begins the fire-us trilogy , fascinating , scary , and intriguing .
the story is really interesting - i mean slap in your face , give-me-more , i love this intersting .
a couple of the images were really disturbing , though , like the fact that hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket .
the kids in the story are fascinating , and the teacher 's scarpbook-thing was so .
.
.
wierd that it was actually kind of scary .
then angerman is introduced .
he 's really messed up , but i get the idea that he knows something about the virus ( fire-us ) that the others do n't .
this makes him an amazing character , and even if you do n't like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy .
i really love this series , though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers .
well worth anyone who is into sci-fi and apocalypse , as i was at the time .
p.s .
i read this book five months ago and i still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks .
talk about powerful writing

when i read ron penton 's first book , data structures for game programming , i could n't wait to see what he did next .
mud game programming lived up to all of my expectations , and indeed surpassed them .
the author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable -- and , equally important , making them interesting .
reading mud game programming is like having a friendly , cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade .
instead of just telling you what to do , he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a mud server , enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project , which might not be the same .
you end up with not just knowledge but understanding .
i highly recommend mud game programming to people doing any type of network-based multiplayer programming , not just traditional muds .
i 'd give this book six stars if they 'd let me

some books are so clinical ; others do n't provide enough information .

haccp is the acronym for hazard analysis of critical control points .
this text , by arduser and brown is the be all and end all on the topic - in my view .
it even comes with a companion cd-rom that contains all forms from the book in adobe acrobat ( pdf ) and ms word format .
this is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired .
the comprehensive 530 + page text covers everything i can think of that relates to food safety in restaurants and other eateries .
it is designed to teach food service managers and their employees the specifics of food safety in accordance with the fda food code .
this excellent training manual is in large print format that makes it easy to read .
the writing is easy to understand and the authors were careful to explain key concepts and terms so that even a novice can study it alone .
the seven comprehensive chapters in the manual cover the following topics : hazards to food safety ; factors affecting food-born illness ; food safety regulations ; following the flow of food ; haccp ; and the facility plan .
these are followed by an extremely helpful glossary of terms .
the appendix includes all forms needed to meet the fda requirements and to run an efficient and safe establishment .
included are checklists , signage , compliance checklists , and equipment cleaning charts , allergen-control program worksheet along with job descriptions for personnel .
there is even a certificate of completion to certify that staff members have taken and passed the required tests ( included ) .
with the rise in reports of food-borne illnesses and deaths it is essential that every food service operation adhere to the regulations and safety procedures at all times .
in my view , this book is essential to ensure you are in total compliance .
as one who has conducted training i find this book deserves 5 stars for its complete coverage of the subject matter in an easy to digest all-in-one format .
i highly recommend this book

i studied the medieval islamic world a little in college , and fell in love .
it 's a fascinating age in which central asian buddhists , north african nomads , ethiopian slaves , greek cave-dwellers , persian aristocrats , arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together , mixed , wrote wonderful literature , and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun .
but it 's hard to find anything written about the time that is n't arcane professor babble or islam 101 .
( you know , " there are five pillars of islam... " snore .
)

here hugh kennedy has written the book i always wanted .
he wisely concentrates on medieval islam 's golden age , the early abbasid dynasty , when baghdad ruled a large portion of the world-and , even more astutely , on the dramatic stories and personalities of the court .
let 's face it , you read about the abbasids because you want to know how the slave girl khayzuran not only managed to marry the caliph but to quell a military revolt , why her son harun al-rashid was immortalized in the arabian nights , and why the all-powerful barmakid family suddenly fell from grace to prison and execution .
kennedy brings the caliphs and their families to life .
he 's up front about the fact that the book is about aristocrats , but the common people of baghdad , the " pickpockets and sellers of cheap sweets " who fought back when their city was besieged , and the middle class who developed islamic tradition dance around the edge of the narrative .
kennedy does n't believe everything he reads , and does n't think you will either .
he repeats stories-like the " harem intrigue " tales , in which devious women are blamed for various deaths-that are almost certainly not true , but tell us something about the people who believed them , and are still enormously entertaining .
he also is frank about the same-sex relationships , male and female , that were a part of the era 's culture , without the awkwardness of many modern historians .
and he 's smart enough to explain the geography-why southern iraq could support such a fabulously wealthy monarchy , and why the afghanistan/ne iran region was so critical to the faraway middle east-in a way an american can understand .
very rare for books on islamic history , the book boasts an excellent map , naming both cities and regions-invaluable for a hapless westerner who does n't know where the major cities of iran are today , never mind where long-gone kingdoms like yamama and ushrusana used to be .
there 's also a surprisingly good index ( another rarity ) .
the book is n't flawless .
kennedy twice awkwardly interrupts his straightforward account of political events with fascinating chapters on aspects of court culture-palaces , poetry , science , and ( my favorite ) women 's lives .
unfortunately , this structure means the reader learns about the palace mutawakkil built before she knows enough about him to care , and does n't hear anything about ma'mun patronage of scientific research until long after he 's dead in the main narrative .
the last chapter goes into far too much detail about the depressing downfall of the dynasty , short-changing a more interesting discussion about its legacy .
but all in all kennedy does a great job , and i for one plan down to hunt down his earlier books .
if you know nothing about islamic history and want an accessible introduction to an fascinating period , or like me know a little and want to learn more , i highly recommend this book

in this study demos examines family life as it was for the pilgrims who came over on the mayflower , before they joined with the massachusetts bay colony .
the book is in three main sections : the physical setting ( housing , furnishings , and clothing ) ; the structure of the household ( family connections , including servants ) ; and individual development ( childhood , coming of age , and old age ) .
the most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the court : although laws were not draconian , they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly .
mess up and you would be punished .
but it 's also true that people were not that different back then , either : parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them ; families were at the core of society 's welfare ; even women were given rights denied them in the mother country .
it 's interesting that even these first settlers saw the american continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized , and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from plymouth itself , thus weakening communal ties .
a highly recommended book

it is the perfect thing to read when you 're in that post-breakup stay-in-bed-in-your-pyjamas-and-eat-ice-cream stage .
beautiful , beautiful work .
if all you have to complain about this book is that you did n't learn how to properly can , you 're missing the point .

i 'm not going to say it 's the best , worst or in between because it 's the only one of this nature i bought .
since then , of course , like most folks , i 've read web sites , talked to others in the hobby and formed my own opinions .
but the reason i bought this book was to cut through the confusion and get started and for that , it was terrific .

next revision , he should throw in a bit more on the fish he picks , offer some alternatives within the scenarios he set up

anna anderson/ anastasia


i have researched this great mystery for some time now and i have concluded that the woman , anna anderson , could not have been an imposter .
not only did she never give any signs of playing a part , but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known .
she knew of gleb botkin 's paintings before he even came to see her , she knew exactly what she and her sister tatiana had been doing while wwi was being declared for russia ( this was confirmed by dr. rudnev who was visiting russia and saw anastasia and tatiana at that time ) , she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in europe , and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone .
one must wonder how a demented polish farming girl could do that .
aside from just her character , there the many scars and lacerations on her body , as well as the bunions on her feet identical to anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support anna anderson 's claim .
for over six decades , royal cousins and friends to anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks .
they would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would .
it is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake .
anna had people such as alexei volkov and alexadra tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched .
no one has ever yet attempted to explain why ambassador zahle and grand duke andrew 's papers are still kept secret , why doris wingender touched up her photographs in court , or why pierre gilliard had his scandalous midnight 'burning ' of evidence .
to this day , anthropologists who compare anna anderson 's face , ears , and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the " two " women are the same .
the franziska schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end .
anna anderson was several inches shorter than franziska schanzkowska , wore a size shoe three inches smaller , was not mentally insane like franziska , she spoke a bad german while fs spoke german as her first language , and could understand russian .
the schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of russian when spoken to them .
aa clearly understood russian .
anderson also gave birth to a child .
there is no record of franziska ever having a child .
recent documents also show that schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on anna anderson 's body .
the dna tests have won the hour , but i hope the future will see the release of ambassador zahle and gd andrew 's papers to cast even more doubt on this .
richard schweitzer 's switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at martha jefferson hospital during the complicated court battle between marina botkin schweitzer and the russian nobiltiy association .
according to massie 's book , one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time .
is it reasonable that the royal families would ignore the fact that anna anderson was about to recieve recognition as the tsar 's daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life ?
in any case , the body of anastasia is still missing , although in russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads 'anastasia ' measuring 5'7 , despite the fact that anastasia was the shortest of her sisters .
if this is n't reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda , i do n't know what is .
i 'm afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over castle seeon under the stone which reads , " anastasia manahan 1901-1984 " .
to end this , i will quote empress alexandra 's best friend ( aside from anna vyrobouva ) lili dehn , who met anna anderson in 1957 ( ?
) and declared , " do n't bother to tell me she has read these things in books .
i have recognized her physically and intuitively , through signs which do not decieve .
what can i say after having known her ?
i could not have been mistaken .
"

this is to explain my conviction that anna anderson was anastasia .
i think there is something about the dna we do not know .
the file on the tsar- 2002 edition... p. 362

'nearly fifty years ago , anna anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in tobolsk .
she played a male part , she 'recalled ' , and and had to borrow a man 's dressing-gown .
at a pivotal moment in the play , a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs , revealing that she was wearing the tsar 's long-johns- against the bitter cold of the siberian winter .
the family , said anna anderson , had hooted with laughter .
the only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene , and who are known to have survived , were the two family tutors-both foreigners .
one was the english tutor , sydney gibbes , and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975 .
they include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in tobolsk .
" the cast , " gibbes wrote , " had its happiest night with an edwardian farce by henry grattan , called 'packing up ' , ... anastasia took the male part... at the end of the farce the 'husband ' had to turn his back , open his dressing-gown as if to take it off- anastasia used an old one of mine... but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back , showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased emperor jaguer 's underwear... '
so far as exhaustive research can establish , only anna anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote , in private and three decades before the gibbes memoirs appeared .
if anderson was a phoney , as the seemingly damning dna evidence now tells us , how did she know the story ?
that was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in anna anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict .
ian lilburn , a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the " anastasia " appeal process in the german courts , had a calmer response than some .
" i think , " he said , knowing he sounded like a luddite and romanov flat-earther , " there is something we do n't know about the dna .
"


maybe after reading you can understand why some of us do n't believe the dna was anna anderson 's , and why we do n't believe she was the tall , size '36 shoe wearing franziska schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter .

it 's been around two years since i first read this book , and i must say i reference it to people all the time .
the reason : it is so darn fascinating .
i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data .
if i gave you an 8-track tape right now , would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it ?
younger folks might not know what it is .
they would recognize tape ( maybe ) , but 100 years from now , how many players would be around ?
the book talks about a project the author was on .
a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans ( or others ) in the future that the site is radioactive .
since the radiation could last 10,000 years , the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now .
what would the message be like ?
if you read the book you 'll find out !
lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just could n't put the book down .
buy it , have fun

things are going swimmingly in fish !
land .
in the latest volume , fish !
tales , authors stephen c. lundin , john christensen , harry paul and philip strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first fish book .
tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center ; a hospital neural-renal unit , a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied fish !
theories effectively .
they also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the fish !
function .
the four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun , seek to serve others , stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive .
along the way , the authors heavily sell their fish !
courses and merchandise - that 's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section , showing ways to apply these principles in any organization .

while some may think that good work should be " readable and enjoyable , " great work is meant to elevate us .
stun us , amaze us , fill us with wonder .
otherwise , see spot run would be a masterpiece .
william faulkner is a writer the likes of which we may never see again .
he is not only brilliant of word but of concept .
he creates a picture not only by text , but by context and form .
in many ways , his works sculpt .
how else would we see things from the vistas of the characters , especially those who ca n't speak but by setting and demonstration ?
one reviewer cursed his conveyance of emotion by " using big words .
" writing is the art of language interplay , the use of beautiful and succinct language .
faulkner uses language that most of us have never heard of but when we take the time to look up that language , the effect is stunning and makes the experience all the more worth it .

the reviewers above and below warn that the novel is difficult to read .
if you a person of average intelligence , all you need is a character list and a careful reading and you will have absolutely no problem finding your way through the greatest novel ever written .
( it 's an incredibly easy read the second time around .
)

the sound and the fury is a summation of faulkner 's works .
everything that is done in the rest of his novels was first done in the sound and the fury .
the sound and the fury is poignant and tragic .
it is monumental in its mythical power .
it is southern and yet it is universal .
it is faulkner 's triumph as a novelist .
it is a study of human consciousness , perception , and existence .
the novel follows the decline and eventual fall of the compson family .
in faulkner 's world of yoknapatawpha county , the compsons and sartorises , the sutpens and de spains , in other words , the established old families of jefferson declined as the invasive and unethical snopes , portraits of the modern businessman , ascended to power .
the story is an intimate portrayal of the compsons , and yet it is a symbolic and mythical account of decline and tragedy .
why is it the greatest novel ever written ?
it takes the innovations in narrative technique as developed by joyce and woolf in the movements of european modernism ( which it does better and with more purpose than joyce and woolf ) and combines them with an exploration of storytelling and an intense devotion to a portrayal of place and region .
the story is great and moving .
the characters are loveable , hateable , tragic , and intensely vivid .
the place is conceived and presented with taxing reality .
the language , as with all of faulkner 's novels , is at times soaring and at times quite terse .
the structure is perfectly balanced and symbolically paired with the passion of christ ( the three days are good friday , holy saturday , and easter sunday ) .
in short , it is the paradigmatic example of what literature can ( and should ) do ; even the greatest of literary feats stand in its shadow

while on maternity leave from cambridge university and with her husband away handling a legal matter in los angeles , professor cassandra james meets her neighbor actress melissa meadows and her spouse keith kingleigh .
melissa and cassandra share an affinity since both recently gave birth prematurely .
kevin is going to direct a production starring melissa .
he asks cassandra to adapt the victorian drama east lynn , which she agrees to do .
as opening night beckons , cassandra notices the cast seems extra nervous .
later an anxious melissa calls cassandra believing that someone is stalking her .
cassandra tries to calm her down .
the next day melissa fails to appear for a rehearsal so cassandra goes to visit her .
melissa is gone without a word , but abandoned her six month old baby that she had shown so much love .
with her own fussy infant at her side , cassandra wonders what happened to her new friend while unable to contact stephen , dealing with the abrupt arrival of her first husband , and detective sergeant vickers suspecting the professor killed the actress .
stage fright , the second professor james tale ( see murder is academic ) , is a fabulous amateur sleuth mystery that builds up the suspense slowly so that the reader like the heroine suspects everyone 's motives .
either foul play occurred or melissa had played the role of a loving mother , but cassandra can not find a motive for either scenario while the evidence points towards her so that even the audience will believe she harmed or murdered the actress .
this is a fantastic english mystery in the christie tradition .

i really enjoyed this book .
i thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book .
there were some character changes and some additional characters in the book , but i do n't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there .
i read the book after seeing the movie - i always wondered what the movie had been based on .
i love baseball , and i think the book was great

this novel is more enjoyable than the flanders panel , but still not up to the level of the fencing master or his recent series , the captain alatriste books .
the characters are well drawn , the setting comes alive , and the story flows .
there are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp , but i can not tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original .
the only real disappointment came when i finished the book : i wish there was a follow-up

people were looking for a book that could grab them about nam when this was a best seller in 1972 , and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days .
magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in nam itself as a primary consideration .
portions of this book originally appeared in ` the new yorker, ' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared .
frances fitzgerald 's original trip to vietnam was in february to november of 1966 , and resulted in articles for the ` atlantic monthly, ' the ` village voice, ' ` vogue, ' etc .
people who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like nam , where large numbers of young americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion .
this book is not perfect .
the only listing for ` tonkin gulf resolution ' in the index is for the page on which president johnson 's use of the resolution is questioned by senator fulbright in 1966 .
that was the time this book is mainly concerned with , but it gives an enormous amount of background information .
it is possible to find a listing in the index under ` gvn ' for ` and u.s. entry into the war , 354 ' which gives the page that reflects secretary of defense robert mcnamara 's testimony to congress that :

" it was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by gvn forces that north vietnamese pt boats attacked the u.s. destroyer maddox , mistaking it for one of the south vietnamese vessels .
" ( pp .
352-353 ) .
actually , the oplan 34a attacks along the gulf of tonkin coastline were operations planned and approved in washington , d.c. , and mcnamara lied about south vietnamese operations to maintain the secret status of u.s. operations , during which the north vietnamese pt boats were responding to recoilless rifle fire from a small boat when american intelligence informed the maddox that it was about to be attacked .
radio intercepts of north vietnamese naval messages on august 4 , 1964 , were used to convince lbj and senators that an attack had occurred when two american destroyers were picking up radar ghosts and sonar readings off the reflection of a hard-turned rudder , as shown by subsequent tests .
edwin e. moise 's book , tonkin gulf and the escalation of the vietnam war has much more information about that secret circus stunt .
jeffrey kimball 's recent book , the vietnam war files : uncovering the secret history of nixon-era strategy , contains a reference to the author of this book in a memorandum by dwight chapin to haldeman , january 18 , 1973 , about a month after heavy bombing near or in hanoi to get some ceasefire agreement signed , hoping it could be called ` the peace announcement ' ( p. 288 ) and attempting to describe a point of view different from what intellectuals were expecting .
" the fitzgeralds and the fondas , the halberstams and harrimans , the clarks and ellsbergs and baezes are poised in the wings just waiting to treat the end of the war as their victory and to so opine from coast to coast .
" ( kimball , p. 291 ) .
i have the first vintage books edition , august 1973 , which was after dwight chapin 's memorandum , but i am not sure if american bombing in cambodia had ended when the actual paper in this book was printed on .
there are only six lines of listings in the index for cambodia , mostly on general issues , but the week i spent there was hardly earth-shaking .
of more interest to me was the report in fire in the lake about the an lao valley , where the battalion 1/12th infantry from the 4th infantry division spent the months from september , 1969 to january , 1970 .
i believe this was our first free fire zone , with a base high above a village that had been destroyed , surrounded by paddies in which elephant grass was growing instead of rice , but enemy soldiers were found harvesting highland rice on the hillsides .
enemy contact was the only kind we had , after all other possibilities had been eliminated in the manner described in this book .
" in operation masher/white wing alone--a multi-regimental sweep through the north of binh dinh province--the allied forces , by the estimates , destroyed an entire enemy division .
in the process they left hundreds of civilians dead and wounded and ` generated ' so many refugees as almost to depopulate the fertile an loa valley .
" ( p. 405 ) .
" while the american troops opened roads and ` cleared ' great stretches of territory , the front guerrillas came back into every area except those heavily garrisoned by u.s. troops .
by the end of 1966 the nlf continued to govern the an lao valley as well as the suburbs of da nang , hue , nha trang , and saigon .
" ( p. 406 ) .
there is only one line in the index for frantz fanon , but anyone who is interested in how fitzgerald saw a link between revolution against colonial powers in african and arab countries and the situation in nam , " including the belief in fate and the symbolic killing of self , which he called ` the behavior patterns of avoidance .
.
.
.
the sudden crime waves that spread through the cities , the tribal warfare , and the fierce , irrational feuding of the native sects .
as he explained them , .
.
.
" ( p.509 ) .
you would n't want to believe how true the stuff in this book could be today

it 's like watching a top notch horror/mystery movie .
this has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone .
i still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now .
i give this book a 5 + + + + star rating

those interested in american art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book .
chicago and new york are the centers from which katharine kuh radiated .
as a museum curator , art dealer , and published critic , she was personally close to many of the modern masters .
in this book , she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives .
i especially liked the chapters on rothko , tobey and noguchi .
disparate side characters , such as judge learned hand and lbj , pop up and add further to the value of ms. kuh 's memoir .
avis berman has done a great service to all those interested in the history of twentieth century american art by completing the memoirs of katharine kuh .
the author 's reflections have been preserved in a form , while still true to the author , that is likely better than had the elderly ms. kuh herself remained alive to complete the job .
notes to the text and a more complete description of katharine kuh 's personal background are some of the very much-appreciated work accomplished by ms. berman

if you 're an easily offended religious fanatic who 's always looking for the vaguest insult or contradiction to your beliefs.. .
i guess you should n't read this .
( actually , you could probably read this one and just skip the sequels .
)

but if you 're anyone else ( of any age ) who enjoys a really awesome story with great characters , adventure , danger , fantastic visual writing , and not a single boring moment , ( well... it might take a little effort to get past the beginning , but that 's coming from a really impatient reader ) then yeah .
go for it .
because there 's just nothing that compares

i was so impressed with this book that i wrote the following letter to its author :

i just completed your book time tactics of very successful people .
the book is truly a masterpiece , and i have found it immeasurably helpful in my ongoing pursuit to become the best person that i can be .
your book is full of wisdom and great ideas , the value of which is many times the price i paid for the book .
i have read the works of personal development legends like napoleon hill , brian tracy , w. clement stone , tony robbins , mark victor hansen and others and have benefited from all of them , but i really enjoyed reading your book because i found that you offered some fresh ideas that these other great men did not .
i am sure that the extraordinary concepts your book provides will enrich my spirit , enlighten my mind , and serve as conduits for achieving my goals for the rest of my life .
i really liked the way that you ended the book .
the quote you gave from earl nightengale perfectly reflects my philosophy for successful living , but helped me crystallize my thinking in a way that has helped refines my philosophy further .
thanks again for providing the world such a valuable resource , a guide which i am certain has helped and will continue to help many others to live happier , more productive , and more peaceful lives .

most people are in awe of the " classic .
" however , a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts , rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition .
classics do not only thrill and teach , they also live .
the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas is a classic .
this tale of accusal , love , betrayal , imprisonment , redemption , and retribution , defies genre .
recounting the plot serves no purpose , so i will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward .
edmond dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him ; he expected to return to those who remained faithful .
here dumas , using dantes , sinbad , albert and abbe busoni , championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life .
the count of monte cristo is a vivid potrayal of french life after the revolution , an epic account of a man 's quest for closure and an inspiration for the shawshank redemption .
it is never too late to read it

at 37 , john wade was lieutenant governor of minnesota .
at 40 , he ran for the u.s. senate .
he was heavily favored to win .
at 41 , he was n't just beaten in the primary , he was crushed --- " loser by landslide .
"

what happened ?
john wade had a secret .
as secrets will , it came out at the worst possible time .
and , suddenly , he was no longer a rising star --- he was a war criminal , a killer of babies , a man to be shunned .
his secret was my lai .
the vietnam war is now so far from us , and american history --- especially the history of a war we lost --- is so sketchily taught , and some of you are so very young that i really ought to take a minute here and , in quick brushstrokes , relate what happened in a little vietnam village on march 16 , 1968 .
better idea : let tim o'brien tell it .
he arrived in vietnam a year later , and served as a foot soldier there for a year .
got wounded , got traumatized , the whole deal .
here 's his account :

at approximately 7 : 30 on the morning , a company of roughly 115 american soldiers was inserted by helicopter just outside the village of my lai .
they met no resistance .
no enemy .
no incoming fire .
still , for the next four hours , charlie company killed whatever could be killed .
they killed chickens .
they killed dogs and cattle .
they killed people , too .
lots of people .
women , infants , teen-agers , old men .
the united states army 's criminal investigation division compiled a list of 343 fatalities and an independent army inquiry led by lieut .
gen. william r. peers estimated that the death count may have exceeded 400 .
at the son my memorial , a large tablet lists 504 names .
according to col. william wilson , one of the original army investigators , " the crimes visited on the inhabitants of son my village included individual and group acts of murder , rape , sodomy , maiming , assault on noncombatants and the mistreatment and killing of detainees .
"

eventually , after a cover-up that lasted more than a year and after the massacre made nationwide headlines , the army 's criminal investigation division produced sufficient evidence to charge 30 men with war crimes .
of these , only a single soldier --- first lieut .
william laws calley , jr. --- was ever convicted or spent time in prison .
found guilty of the premeditated murder of " not less than " 22 civilians , calley was sentenced to life at hard labor , but after legal appeals and sentence reductions , his ultimate jail time amounted to three days in a stockade and four and a half months in prison .
terrible , terrible .
( and ironic : seymour hersh , who broke the my lai story , now writes about the iraq war for the new yorker .
) but in fiction , o'brien does n't play judge and jury .
john wade may have been at my lai and done terrible things there , but he found a way to live with his shame .
and here 's the remarkable thing --- tim o'brien bends over backward to see it wade 's way .
what i tell you now may seem like a plot " spoiler .
" it 's not .
" in the lake of the woods " is a mystery --- maybe even a thriller --- but it 's totally innovative in form .
that is , we know right off that something happened .
the first question is : what happened ?
and then a gloomier question : who did it ?
what we know : after the primary defeat , john wade and his wife kathy retreat to a cabin in the lake of the woods , a part of northern minnesota so remote that there 's nothing but water and islands between it and canada .
thirty-six hours later , kathy disappears .
did she flee ?
did she drown ?
did her husband --- reliving his vietnam experience --- kill her and dump her body into the lake ?
not easy questions .
and o'brien does n't answer them : " i tried to make each hypothesis plausible .
john may have killed kathy .
or kathy may have run off with someone else .
or maybe she simply drowned .
or got lost in that vast wilderness .
i believed in each hypothesis as i wrote it .
i inserted evidence to support each hypothesis --- just as life itself gives us contradictory evidence about a great many things .
but in the end , it 's all a mystery , insoluble , beyond certainty .
"

and to make it more mysterious , o'brien tells the story from multiple perspectives .
offers testimony from many people .
cites historical documents .
and then amps up the uncertainly by giving wade a hobby --- magic .
and maybe that 's what it comes down to --- an ungainly kid , an abusive father , a need for approval that never got satisfied .
as o'brien writes :

" a fat little kid doing magic in front of a stand-up mirror .
'hey , kiddo , that 's a good one, ' his father could 've said , but for reasons unknown , reasons mysterious , the words never got spoken .
he had wanted to be loved .
and to be loved he had practiced deception .
he had hidden the bad things .
he had tricked up his own life .
only for love .
only to be loved .
"

too simple ?
a clue that takes you away from the solution ?
could be : o'brien is that good .
( he won the national book award for " going after cacciato " .
the new york times named the things they carried as one of the best books of the year in 1990 --- and chose " in the lake of the woods " for that list four years later .
)

this much is sure : you start " in the lake of the woods " expecting one kind of book and quickly get another , darker , scarier book .
you find yourself thinking " god , this is awful , " even as you read faster and faster .
you cringe at what wade might have done , wince for what might have been done to him .
and , as he comes apart , so do you .
this is a harrowing book , as grown-up as it gets .
it 's a great story , masterfully told .
and more : it draws you in , demands your opinion .
and then it demands your honest opinion --- because you have your secrets too , do n't you

the gospel of judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame .
it is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the christian faith .
like its many predecessors , it gave national geographic and anti-christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of jesus .
a book titled the gospel of judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly , shot straight back down .
still , while its popularity was short-lived , it allowed bart ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of christ .
surely ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered , " ( the gospel of judas ) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century .
it rivals the finding of the dead sea scrolls or the gnostic gospels of nag hammadi .
"

national geographic describes the importance of the document in this way : " the gospel of judas gives a different view of the relationship between jesus and judas , offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed jesus .
unlike the accounts in the canonical gospels of matthew , mark , luke , and john , in which judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor , this newly discovered gospel portrays judas as acting at jesus ' request when he hands jesus over to the authorities .
" a classically dualistic , gnostic document , the gospel of judas presents a jesus who is seeking to escape from the corruption of this physical world and asks judas to betray him so he can be free of this wickedness .
judas complies and shows himself to be a hero , rather than a villain .
no longer the betrayer , he is a faithful friend to jesus christ .

no longer the betrayer , he is a faithful friend to jesus christ .
renowned new testament scholar n.t .
wright is the first christian to my knowledge to write a thorough refutation of the teachings of the gospel of judas .
judas and the gospel of jesus is due for publication in october of 2006 and will be published by baker books .
it is a short book , weighing in at only 144 pages , but provides a thorough treatment of the subject matter .
wright is fair to this newly published document .
he does not say that there is no value in the gospel of judas for surely there is , for it tells us much about the gnosticism that was a great opponent of early christianity .
it gives historians access to an authentic , original document .
but it tells us nothing about the real jesus and the real judas .
those who would have us believe that this letter provides details about the real life of the real jesus can be little more than revisionists .
wright shows that such people believe in what he calls " the new myth of christian origins .
" this myth , popularized by men such as bart ehrman , has three main teachings : first , jesus was not as the canonical gospels portray him ; second , there were a great many different varieties of early christianity , and they produced a large number of different " gospels , " all of which circulated among christians more or less unchecked ; third , when christianity became consolidated in the fourth century , many teachings about the " true " christian faith were rejected .
" classic christianity , " he says , " has a lot more life and promise than have ever been imagined by those who propose the new myth , or by those who offer newly discovered gnostic texts as the panacea for our ills .
it is a shame that the churches have been so muzzled , so often self-blinded to the full dimensions of the gospel they profess , the gospel of jesus himself .
"

through this short book , wright asks good questions and insightfully shows where the gospel of judas simply can not be held as equal in any way to scripture .
he shows himself to be a new testament scholar the equal of any involved in promoting this new gospel .
while the document appears to be genuine , it is little different and little more significant than the multitudes of other gnostic writings which have come down to us , even two millenia later .
it is perhaps somewhat ironic that n.t .
wright , who has reimagined and reinvented many of the teachings of paul ( and thus jesus ) , would be the first to make a stand for the truth against others who would seek to reinvent jesus .
unfortunately , wright 's new perspectives are glimpsed , even if only dimly , through much of the text of this book .
still , he offers a compelling response to ehrman and others and one well worth reading .
i would tend to believe that , for most people , the gospel of judas is best ignored .
it offers little that would be of interest to the average person .
for those who do have interest in it , judas and the gospel of jesus will no doubt prove an interesting response to the irrational views espoused by those who wish to reinvent christianity and to cast doubt upon scripture

peter robinson is one of my favorite authors .
when i travel on vacation i make sure to take his latest novel .
" piece of my heart " transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago .
the characters were well developed and the story line moved .
there were many layers of sub-plots that were interwoven .
i thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion .

" de-mystifying " a musical genre is a favorite practice of many historians , educators , and musicians , and has been overdone .
unlike them , but not unlike a master performer , palmer is able to strike a balance between technique , feeling , and authenticity : he is historically and musically adept without denying the blues its inherent mystery and evocative nuance .
palmer put his life into this work and it shows ; he without a doubt " convinces " .
i highly recommend his deep blues .

the plot is stronger than dick and jane , not quite at the dr. seuss level .

this is probably the single best work i 've ever seen on the &quot ; science&quot ; of packing .
joe back lived and worked in n.w .
wyoming , and was a legend in the area .
his humorous annecdotes , and extremely accurate hand drawn diagrams , combined with his obvious knowledge of the subject , make this a &quot ; must have&quot ; for anyone seriously interested in learning how to pack horses or mules , and survive .
this little work deserves a place in any packer 's library

some previous reviewers have complained about the complex style and writing of this book .
although in fact it is not an easily readable book , for the general public , if you have a serious interest about the history of the third reich , make no mistake : you will not be able to overlook this book , which will surely be a classic .
it is a thoroughly well researched contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism ; the interaction between the " new " domestic and international values , based on aggression ; and the other causes involved in the rise ( and fall ) of the iii reich .
from a different perspective from other mainstream historians , this winner of the samuel johnson prize for non fiction , has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat , one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular period of history .
no wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this opus -a new history- particularly well deserved .
of great interest is the chapter related with the demise of the rule of law , a thorough analysis of the penetration of the judiciary and the subordination of the police and government to the totalitarian fuhrerprinzip

as a professional bridal consultant , i keep an extensive library of wedding related books on hand to help my brides design their own weddings .
ms. mcbride 's bridal flowers is one of my favorites .
it is full of wonderful ideas - not just the traditional " must have " wedding flowers such as bouquets &amp ; boutonnieres , but the out-of-the-ordinary ( but inspiring ) boas , decorated lampposts &amp ; gilded calla lilies .
ms. mcbride shows that flowers are for more than just being carried or worn .
the large color photos are fantastic .
so many other books have little or no photos , or hand drawn diagrams that leaves the reader wondering .
ms. mcbride 's book lets you see exactly what she is talking about .
it does n't claim to be a how-to book , but perfect to take along when visiting your floral designer

this rare book details aleister crowley 's ascension as the prophet of a new aeon , the aeon of horus .
out of all the aleister crowley books in mass market format , this stood out in memory years after i read it as one of crowley 's most disturbing works .
in fact , i questioned my new faith in crowley 's religion thelema reading this book ; this was for real and not a joke .
after contemplating , i thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today 's youth and crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today .
this is serious stuff , i would n't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult .
it should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work ; i did a ritual from necronomicon and lesser key of solomon to help with a college astronomy course- i got a respectable c grade when i close to failing with a d- .
but be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism .

twain 's account of his years on the mississippi is part travel book , part memoir , and part historical work , with a few sketches , stories , and tall tales tossed in for good measure .
there is even an outtake from the not-yet-published " huckleberry finn , " along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors .
this smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book , but much of it shows mark twain at his humorous and humanistic best .
the kernel of the volume ( and its best , most cohesive section ) is in chapters 4 through 17 ; this material appeared in the atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s .
his adventures as a young man are fraught with danger , full of comedy , populated by a number of ornery , mischievous , and reckless characters , and occasionally embellished ( although twain is a bit obvious when he 's fobbing off a yarn ) .
as twain later wrote in " puddn'head wilson , " if there was anything better in this world than steamboating , it was the glory to be got by telling about it .
"

after he published the series in the atlantic , twain added another 46 chapters ; much of it an account of his homecoming ( incognito--or so he 'd hoped ) to the mississippi river in 1882 , when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad .
many of these descriptions are unusually ( for twain ) melancholy ; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous .
his new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion .
the material from other sources , unfortunately , tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices .
twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents ; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors , primarily europeans distracted by how americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty .
( you almost get the feeling that twain would have smacked " the once renowned and vigorously hated " frances trollope upside the head if he 'd had the chance ; she provides twain with the most interesting , if snooty , descriptions of traveling along the mississippi early in the century .
)

the material twain wrote , however , more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff .
as always , he is quotable , witty , amusing , and provocative .
in spite of its excesses , nobody has done the mississippi better

how this book flew under the nation 's radar---i 'll ever know .
furthermore it 's discouraging as hell because it only goes to prove that great work so often goes unrecognized .
this book plays out like a spielberg movie from page one .
very spielbergian because of it 's perfect blend of adventure , romance and humor .
the characters are dynamic and interesting as hell .
the storyline is straight out of an indiana jones serial , and it keeps building until you 're reading as fast as you possibly can just to see what happens .
the art work is astounding .
these are the coolest-looking heroes , sexiest women , and the most powerful looking baddies i 've ever seen penciled in my life .
it 's just a shame that this book is n't getting the buzz that crap like " ultimate spider-man " is getting---because in all reality this is the best graphic novel on the shelves right now---and could easily be the film adaptation that could return steven spielberg to greatness .
for once in a very long time...i 'm truly blown away .

on the way to a conference in new orleans , my flight from raleigh to charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems , and i was booked on a flight to d.c. as i boarded the plane with &quot ; the carolina way&quot ; under my arm , a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how i was enjoying the book .
i explained that i had not yet started the book , so i could not give an answer .
the gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as dr. gerald bell , the co-author of &quot ; the carolina way&quot ; .
myself a carolina fan , i was pleased to meet dr. bell , as he spent several minutes talking about coach smith , whom i have admired for over forty years , and the unc basketball program , which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under coach roy williams .
dr. bell 's contributions to the book tie coach smith 's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from carolina 's storied history to today 's business situations .
surely , coach smith , given his ability to recruit top players , has been criticized by many for his failure to win ncaa championships in the manner of coach john wooden at ucla , but winning two ncaa championships , winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict ncaa rules , and coaching top players that graduated at a + 90 % rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of coach smith 's &quot ; system&quot ; .
teamwork , integrity , loyalty , and hard work , are the cornerstones of the carolina way , and anyone in the position of managing , leading , or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book , corny as it is at times .
this book is not just for carolina basketball fans

this is my favorite jonathan kellerman novel .
the book focuses on a disturbing story about munchausen 's disease by proxy .
this book so quickly caught my interest , that i ended up doing my psych 101 paper on this disease .
i had not heard of this disorder when i read the book .
it was disturbing , intense , and tore away at your heart .
i would definitely recommend this book !
munchausen 's disease seems to have become a more popular topic since i read this book .
i have seen countless documentaries on , and it was also featured in the newest episode of house .
it is a disturbing , yet intriguing disease , and this book delves straight into the ugliest form of it , munchausen 's disease by proxy

as an overweight , stressed-out , 40-something professional , i am thrilled to find this book !
the spark is exactly what i needed to get my body moving again .
i am one of those who had fallen for the 1-hour a day exercise trap , and if i did n't have an hour , which i usually do n't , i just did n't exercise .
i love doing my three to four sparks a day , knowing i am doing my body far more good than waiting for that elusive day when i can fit in 45 minutes or more for my workout .
this is a wonderful concept , and so doable !
it 's working ! !

always think twice .
never jump to hasty conclusions without considering all the effects of an act or decision .
that 's the essence of economics : " looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy .
"

most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson , as henry hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book .
are there benefits in destruction ( let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war ?
is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble ?
can taxes benefit the economy of a country ?
do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions ?
are all labor union practices truly justified ?
and , what about tariffs , subsidies , parity prices , rent control , or minimum wage laws ?
these are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear , read , or see on the media .
beyond what you may think about the government 's role in the economy , whether you agree or not with the author 's liberal views , " economics in one lesson " shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees .
as the author points out , half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies .
demagogues and 'rogue ' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision ( or , in the worst cases , on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action ) .
learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do .
btw , " economics in one lesson " might be a good place to start. .

i found this in the church library , but it is not christian fiction .
it is simply an easy read .
the story is sweet , made even sweeter by the topic .
cake .
i am not even much of a cake person .
i normally prefer ice cream or some sort of brownies/cookies , etc.. .
but , as i read , i found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator .
i do n't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet .
the need for sweets will be simply overpowering

overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a do .
the mix of recipes is fine , but they just seemed to be missing something .
they were all more or less of the &quot ; huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done&quot ; variety .
all of the recipes look tasty , though i would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes , especially some more creative ones .
let 's be honest , when you pay for a book you 'd like to see more than &quot ; ...put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated dutch oven , salt and pepper to taste , cook until done.&quot ; give me a little something to work with here !
inspire me !
i can already cook a roast like this in the oven .
having said all of that , i would still reccommend this book .
the vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and i ca n't wait to try some of them .
as an aside , this is the only dutch oven book i 've seen with heart-healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare .
given that the average do book requires the use of a metric ton of lard , this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks

&quot ; the shaman 's apprentice&quot ; presents more information about the relationship between people and nature than many much larger volumes .
the story of kamanya , gabriela , and the shaman nahtahlah , educates children about the important roles of all living things .
the text is supported by rich and colorful illustrations which easily maintains the interest of children from four to 14 .
if you want the children in your life to understand the importance of rain forests and the need to preserve them , you must have this book

john gunther 's inside u.s.a. comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get , hurling us back to the america of 1947 , as he explores , state by state , the people , politics , issues , passions and fads that make up our country .
written with great energy and insight , gunther captures an america justly proud of its wwii success , still unsure of its role in the world , and populated by fascinating characters like mayor laguardia of new york , governor saltonstall of massachusetts and boss hague of jersey city .
gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today .
he captures aspects of america that are gone,l never to return ( an &quot ; industrial&quot ; nation based on coal , iron ore and steel .
) and he foresees issues that dog america to this day -- the &quot ; negro problem&quot ; ( actually , the &quot ; white problem.&quot ; ) he condemns the segregationist society he finds in america , so inconsistent with its lofty ideals .
as you can tell , i loved this book .
it 's very hefty -- but every time you are about to put it down , gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading .
all this said , gunther does concentrate on the ( a ) historical , ( b ) political and ( c ) economic side of things .
you wo n't find much here about the arts or science .
but it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly

this is the sixth and final addition to the author 's excellent holiday time series , just in time for rosh hashanah !
as in the other titles , ( it 's challah time !
it 's seder time !
etc .
) tod cohen 's full-color photos capture the joyousness of the children as they learn to celebrate the holiday wearing new clothes , making jewish new year 's cards for their families , tasting new foods such as pomegranates and star fruits , and blowing the shofar .
the sounds of the shofar are explained in easy , understandable terms for this young age level .
the children are also shown learning such things as tying their shoes and writing their names .
the brief amount of text on each page and very appealing children pictured learning to make round challot and blow the shofar make this just right for using with pre-schoolers , their parents , and in the classroom .
included is an easy shofar craft and a brief paragraph about rosh hashanah .
recommended for all jewish libraries .
ages : 4-6 .
