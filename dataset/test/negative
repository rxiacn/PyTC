i suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda .
that being said , in this book , mr. dilorenzo seems to play fast and loose with the facts ( or at least with his conclusions ) .
the flyleaf of this book promises " extensive research and meticulous documentation " but at least one other reviewer has already pointed out some problems with this author 's historical research .
that should raise a red flag to anyone reading this book .
consider this : the author claims lincoln was more interested in building an american " empire " by centralizing federal power than ending slavery .
this implies lincoln was premeditated in what he would do as president .
i challenge anyone who believes that to read lincoln 's actual words and , more importantly , examine his actions .
this we know : abraham lincoln was a complicated man and , as a thoughtful person , his views on slavery changed during his many years in public life .
he came to believe that slavery would not die out on its own .
i do recommend purchasing and reading this book since it is so different from the mythical view we have of lincoln today .
however , when it comes to some of the " facts " and conclusions expounded in this book be very careful what you believe

the book is brilliant , no question about it .
his stories are great , his humor dry and culturally insightful .
the problem is that , like all audio books , the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience .
and in this case , unfortunately , the voice of the author fails the material .
sorry , bill , but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book .
it 's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep .
i would n't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic ( as i did , and almost got into an accident ) .
if you want this book , get the paperback

dr. gray must be a wonderful lover .
as a woman i read his hints and suggestions for a man 's love making technique and marvel at his insight .
i truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom .
however there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover .
by maintaining a position of gallant " ladies first " mentality he , in truth , is demeaning the power of women 's sexuality .
there is much to be gained by men reading this book .
attitudes can improve , skill levels can rise and even the articulation of loving feelings can be created and/or grow with the help of this book 's suggestions .
women are unfortunately reduced to being receipients of , not participants in , in bedroom activity

my 60s something father gave me this book .
i am a 45-year-old middle-class man with a 6-year-old son using my wife 's account .
i do n't understand for whom this book is written .
it is full of painfully obvious advice such as " do n't play with your food " or " do not throw golf clubs... in anger .
" anyone raised in america ( presuming that is the author 's intended audience ) who does n't already understand these things and take them to heart is n't going to be interested in reading about them in a book , if they can even read .
chapter 15 deals with staring and differences where the author admonishes : " do not repeat racist , sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence .
" if you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this .
if you are , this book is n't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it .
i found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet .
if the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated , dream on !
i think the author has a professor henry higgins jones .
i am also concerned about my father 's opinion of me , i mean " do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store .
" duh

the publishers should be sued .
maybe we should get a class-action together .
imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first apple computer and putting a new title on it " how to use your new home computer " and selling it in bookstores today .
this book is doing exactly that !
also , it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place .
the author 's website vanished years ago .
in a thinly traded nyse stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with 2000 share orders he will simply move the price 50 cents against you immediately following your next purchase .
game over .

i concur with another reviewer : get luigi gambero 's " mary and the fathers of the church , " and , i might add , his follow-up work , " mary in the middle ages .
" read these two books alongside " truly our sister .
.
. , " then decide whether 15 or 16 centuries of organic , historically contiguous development of the church 's marian doctrine by some of the finest minds and hearts the church has ever produced--including bridget of sweden , or johnson 's glib , 21st century , feminist revisionism provides the better spiritual nourishment .
the blessed virgin mary stirs us to properly love her divine son , bringing us into the intimate recesses of the trinitarian love itself !
anything shy of that simply misses the point and leaves one painfully short-changed .

i had high hopes when i picked up this book because styron is a terrific writer and i was interested in the subject .
by the time i was done i nearly threw it across the room .
admittedly , depression makes for a tough topic , but that 's not good enough .
there 's more to depression than staring at an empty page , unable to muster the courage to write one single word .
the dark places of the soul also have their fires , their drama , even if they are played out in secret .
i will grant that the writing is spare and elegant , as you would expect .
but i would have traded all the insider literati name-dropping for one paragraph that gave me a visceral sense of how he felt , something that put me there with him .
i have read instruction manuals for appliances with more passion and conviction .
styron is candid about his descent into alcoholism , but the self-destruction inherent in alcoholism does not imply the elimination of ego , frequently it heralds the triumph of ego .
in darkness visible , styron maintains egomaniacal control of his subject through aloof detachment , showcasing a carefully polished veneer , never inviting the reader in .

as someone very interested in urban exploration ( especially in the subways ) i wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it .
after reading many of these amazon reviews though , i opted out of a purchase , and took it out of my bronx library instead .
thank goodness as i only wasted valuable time , and not any money .
this book is a sham .
it is obviously mostly fiction .
and it 's boring fiction at that .
the book is divided into chapters , each chapter a new " adventure .
"

i read the subway one first , where the " explorers " take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line , to see the city hall station , which opened in 1904 ( nyc 's first station ) and closed in 1948 .
the station is located on the loop of the 6 train , that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop , brooklyn bridge .
first of all , anyone can go on this " adventure .
" just stay on the train at the last stop , brooklyn bridge , and that 's it .
despite the author 's attempt to make this sound risky , no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on ( like they really care ) , just sit down .
the author created some " european tourists " that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop , and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying " are we on the wrong train ?
" well , unless all those huge " 6 " signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read , then you probably got on the correct train .
the author also fails to mention that the mta used to give public tours all the time through this station ( and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more ) but stopped after 9-11 .
this chapter was a joke .
i started reading the other chapters , and saw they were no better .
i then started to breeze through the book .
one thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all .
this , despite the fact that on page 67 the author states , " josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle... " but no photos of their " adventures " are in the book .
why ?
because it 's fiction .
there are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring , sure , that 's easy .
there 's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere , ooo .
buit no pics of the actual " adventures .
" i guess " josh " lost all those pictures when he went to cvs to have them developed .
the funny thing is , you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself .
especially the city hall station , there are tons of pictures of it available from the people that were in there during the tours .
just stay away from this sham of a book , it 's really a huge waste of time

not that i do n't like shakespeare 's works , but his tragedies are terrible , especially this one .
i ca n't understand the language real well , so i have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it 'll be easier to understand .
i just ca n't understand this love tragedy at all !
here are some things that confuse me :

* how did this feud really begin ?
* why ca n't this story end in happily ever after ?
* why does lady capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody ?
* why could n't shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand ?
* why does everybody have to jump to conclusions ?
i simply ca n't understand why people love this play so much .
it 's ridiculous !
if you want a true love story , try reading " a midsummer night 's dream " .
this one absolutely sucks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

i wanted to cry when i put this book down because i miss the danielle steele that wrote 'thurston house ' , 'family circle ' and others .
for years now i have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers .
i really feel like her heart just is n't in it anymore .
she has become very idiosyncratic and predictable .
every book has her main character 'being honest .
' i keep reading because i am a loyal danielle steele fan and i write this in hopes she 'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it ( like she once did ) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works .
this book was just awful .

i received this book as a gift .
i was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as bob novak and sean hannity .
have n't any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book ?
no .
and with good reason .
it 's not a history book , it 's a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk " the faithful " out of their hard-earned dollars .
i did read several chapters of the book to be fair .
when crocker describes the papal forces during the albigensian crusade as " soldiers of god , overcoming all the odds to destroy the wicked oppression challenging the authority of the church .
" i wanted to puke .
and how about the inquisition , where church authorities sanctioned physical torture against " heretics ?
" well , crocker concedes that torturing someone might stray a little bit from christ 's original message of tolerance... but hey , they threatened the authority of the righteous catholic church , so they got what they deserved .
uh , yeah , amen brother .
these considerations aside , the book is n't even well researched , which immediately destroys its credibility with me .
for example from the albigensian crusade , crocker states that the armies of the heretics numbered over 100,000 , yet with only a few thousand men , the pope was able to defeat them , as they were filled with the " glory of god " or something like that .
curiously , in his footnotes he cites nothing to back this claim up .
maybe because it is n't true .
and any cites to books that have been critical of church policy , like , say , endorsing mussolini , are derided as " unresearched , " " politically motivated " and " shameful "

ironically , that 's exactly what " triumph " is to me

this is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you do n't have faith in the supernatural , you have no reason for hope .
according to this book , the rational world is such an unpleasant place that , if you are not religious as schaeffer defines religious , " [ t ] he only way of escape lies in a nonrational fantasy world of experience , drugs , absurdity , pornography , an elusive " final experience , " madness.. .
.
"

piffle !
throughout history , a great many people found life to be good without resorting to either madness or schaeffer 's brand of religion .
and indeed , religion and rationality need not be foes , as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers , such as isaac asimov and stephen jay gould .
reduces our choices to " religion or madness " is just silly .
schaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality , but authoritarianism with a clerical face .
his fans wo n't like that characterization , but my job as a reviewer is to tell you what 's in the book ; if you seek comfort in authoritarian religion , this book 's skillful wordcraft makes it is a good place to start

as a certified information systems security professional , i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever .
i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here , and i 'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it .
the most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle " an integrated approach to security in the organization .
" the book not only lacks effective security integration techniques , it does n't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration .

like many others in my book group , i had been looking forward to finally reading something by pamuk .
and like most of my book group , i was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him .
originally published in turkey in 1985 , the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one faruk darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive .
he then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated , but much of it ca n't .
this should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes .
even more so if the reader knows that darvinoglu is the protagonist of pamuk 's earlier book the house of silence .
such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of calvino , borges , and their ilk .
the basic plot is very straightforward : in the mid 17th-century , a young venetian gentleman is captured by turkish raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring turkish scholar who happens to look just like him .
the two men then spend the next few decades cloistered together , engaged in various psuedo-intellectual investigations of astronomy , biology , engineering , and so on .
these bring them to the attention of the sultan ( based on mehmet iv ) , whose patronage waxes and wanes , culminating in a lengthy attempt to construct a powerful war machine .
along the way , their claustrophobic relationship swings back and forth , and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague , whose outcome they are tasked with predicting .
the book concludes with a brief section which will challenge the reader 's assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it .
namely , are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a single person ?
this all unfolds at a glacial pace , and the two " characters " are mere ciphers .
their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page , but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it , and this makes for disengaging reading .
pamuk seems much less interested in storytelling or characters than in grand themes such as the nature of identity , the collision of cultures , and the very nature of reality .
but none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly fresh or interesting .
the tension between east and west is handled in a fairly superficial manner , as the turkish master is obsessed with western advances in science and technology , while the sultan has a credulous appetite for tall tales and soothsayers .
this all comes across as a rather ambivalent satire of the fluidity of turkish national character .
in the end , this is not a particularly good introduction to major modern writer whom many have compared to eco , calvino , borges , kafka , and kundera .
however , readers who enjoy highly ambiguous works about self-identity with unreliable narrators may find this a satisfying read

sorry , but i found this book a total waste of time .
i never did like the main character - i found her boring !
i laughed out loud when i read another reviewer say that " this person escaped her life to be a secretary ?
" - good point !
it was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this " new " life without really taking time to search her soul .
instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.as far as the ending of the book goes - i could n't have cared less what happened to her anyway !
after reading it ( book on tape ) i felt i had totally wasted my time .
what a disappointment

the author comes off as a whining , unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling ' church environment ; further apalled by the church founder 's belief , in that it ( the worlwide church of god ) was god 's true church through the ages , right on up to the present 'end time' .
feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on herbert w. armstrong,the church 's actual teachings , and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole , labeling it a 'cult'...and further damning its pastor general as a " heretic " , despite the church 's humanitarian works , publishing , colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of h.w .
armstrong .
since armstrong 's death in 1986 , feazell and his cohort joseph tkach jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains , and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic holy days , sabbaths , ten commandments ( which , in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions ' ) and general lifestyle of this 7th day church of god denomination .
mr. feazell apparently does not speak for all the church membership , as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent church of god conferences throughout the united states...and continuing the legacy and apostolic , traditional christian system of worship restored by herbert w. armstrong in 1927 .
recommended reading : " autobiography of herbert w. armstrong " ; " mystery of the ages " ; " the incredible human potential "

john katzenbach is an accomplished author and i had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels ( the analyst ) , so i was surprised at how bad the shadow man was .
the premise of the plot is that four very old jewish people , survivors of the holecaust , believe they have seen the " shadow man " .
the shadow man was a jew who joined forces with the nazis to find jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps .
these four old people feared the shadow man more than anything .
when one of them is killed , a retired police detective named simon winter looks into who the shadow man is .
meanwhile , the miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect .
eventually , winter and the police and the district attourney join to hunt the shadow man , a man of pure evil .
as the book villian , it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s .
also , this book barely touches on wwii , yet purports at times to be a novel about wwii .
i 've read a lot of great wwii novels , and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s .
but setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters was n't too exciting .
it was n't exciting primarily because i wondered where had the shadow man been all these years ?
why was he starting to kill now ?
the shadow man had no motivation to kill .
finally , i realized i did n't like this book when i was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages .
the entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story .
if you take away the wwii angle , this novel is bad .
the wwii angle adds some excitement , but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of wwii better than this one does .
the review from publishers weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated... " katzenbach ( just cause ) has some good holocaust and wwii vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here , but the book is burdened by flat characterization , a slow pace , an odd , unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing .

i have been a huge fan of the anna pigeon mysteries .
the hard truth about hard truth is skip it .
it is a very unpleasant experience .
the graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill .

what i 've loved about the anna pigeon series is that i felt like i got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area .
i doubt anna spent more than a night in rocky mountain national park .
not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story .
the whole thing could have taken place in urban chicago .
i have been picking up nevada barr books as fast as i could find them .
this book , however , was truely repulsive .
i 'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book

jeremy narby 's the cosmic serpent : dna and the origins of knowledge , started out decently enough with narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the amazon basin and from there he goes over some interesting ideas regarding dna and serpent myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of intelligent design and makes an all out attack on darwinian evolution and science itself .
a number of narby 's ideas regarding dna and shamanism are intriguing enough but he has apparently decided that all shamanism is based on molecular biology , while he freely admits that he is being very reductionist on this point , i still see many problems with his view that shamanism is based on molecular biology at heart .
his argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the serpent/dragon which is present in many different mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins .
he decides that this is in actually a representation of dna as viewed by shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and shamanic visions are actually dna .
since dna emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication ( along with the traditional chemical communication ) narby believes that in shamanic trances the shaman becomes able to see the light emitted by dna ( which often show up as snakes ) and the shaman communicates with the individual bits of dna ( which is conscious ) and the entire linked network of dna based life .
as justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light , to him this is almost literally correct as the spirits are actually dna and communicate through light as " spirits " .
from there he goes on to say that all ladders , staircases , and ropes in shamanic quests are representations of dna and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along dna and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking down to the world of molecular biology ( although since one can apparently work with and see dna in the middle world one must ask why one would need to shrink down ) .
while these views might make for some interesting theological discussion about some shamanic practices , narby seems to have ignored the psychological aspects of visions and quests and any elements other than snakes or other things that just happen to be long and thin .
given narby 's view of spirits as dna one must ask what spiritual helpers/allies are ?
is someone 's spiritual guides dna in some bacteria on my hand ?
will i kill yahweh by washing my hands with anti-bacterial soap ( hey maybe that 's why jesus decided that washing one 's hands was bad ! ) ?
a lot of his proof is like the proof of erich von d ï ¿ ½ niken except that where d ï ¿ ½ niken saw aliens and spacecraft , narby sees dna and molecules .
take for example this d ï ¿ ½ niken-esque proof from the book :

" the second was a rock painting of the rainbow snake .
i looked at it more closely and saw two things : all around the serpent there were sorts of chromosomes , in their upside-down " u " shape , and underneath it there was a kind of ladder !
" ( p. 79 )

by chapter 10 , entitled biology 's blind spot , narby has decided that evolution is wrong and all of science must be toppled .
this bit seems to have come out of nowhere like someone spliced a pro-intelligent design rant into a book where it did n't belong and as with all pro-id and creationist literature we get the same old faulty attacks again and again .
attacks such as evolution being based on a circular argument because the most fit species survive to spread their genes and therefore are more fit .
yes , that is the definition of fitness , and sometimes the basis of things start as tautologies such as the theory of gravity but like gravity natural selection and evolution is justified and testable by looking at it 's predictive power .
population genetics and mathematics shows clearly that natural selection is very predictive and has so far not been falsified .
similarly , we can also look at the fossil record in geological strata for evidence of evolutionary change over time .
after that attack narby then attacks the central dogma ( which is how transcription of dna to proteins works ) by misinterpreting what francis crick meant .
crick never meant the word dogma in central dogma to be taken in the sense it is used in religion instead he meant it as a joke name for a grand hypothesis that he had at the time little actual experimental evidence for .
narby misinterprets crick 's joke to argue that evolution is apparently faith based , since this argument has no basis in reality it falls flat immediately .
he then argues that ants and other animals are fully conscious because they do amazing things that seem to require forethought and they tap into dna like shamans to do things .
higher animals are smart and may have consciousness but ants are pretty dumb .
one is reminded of edward selous and others ' ideas about thought-transference to explain how flocks of birds move and how ants and termites build hives , as it turns out birds flocking behaviour operates on simple instinctual rules ( clustering , maintaining speed , and appropriate distance ) and so are ant nesting behaviours .
one proof of this is to put food just out of the reach of ants , and some dirt underneath , while they understand how to move earth and tunnel they will never purposely move earth to build ramps , bridges , or tunnels to reach a goal .
the birds who flew in flocks and the ancestors of ants who had developed nesting behaviour managed to survive better and so these behaviours somehow became instincts and persisted .
now narby makes the extremely tired argument that life is too complicated to be determined by chance alone , and he is correct on this matter .
too bad there is more than chance guiding evolution , we also have natural selection guiding the process , to quote richard dawkins : " life results from the non-random survival of randomly varying replicators .
" the combinations which work survive and prosper and are kept in the population .
narby argues " how can a small telephone directory of information emerge from random processes ?
" ( p. 142 ) to answer this i wish to quote a bit of michael shermer 's 25 creationists ' arguments and 25 evolutionists ' answers which nicely illustrates how natural selection can produce shakespeare 's hamlet quickly from random letters :

" natural selection is not " random " nor does it operate by " chance .
" natural selection preserves the gains and eradicates the mistakes .
the eye evolved from a single , light-sensitive cell into the complex eye of today through hundreds if not thousands of intermediate steps , many of which still exist in nature .
in order for the monkey to type the first 13 letters of hamlet 's soliloquy by chance , it would take 26 to the power of 13 number of trials for success .
this is 16 times as great as the total number of seconds that have elapsed in the lifetime of the solar system .
but if each correct letter is preserved and each incorrect letter eradicated , the process operates much faster .
how much faster ?
richard hardison constructed a computer program in which letters were " selected " for or against , and it took an average of only 335.2 trials to produce the sequence of letters tobeornottobe .
this takes the computer less than 90 seconds .
the entire play can be done in about 4.5 days !
"

narby also tries to argue that gaps in the fossil record such as in whale evolution and other places where there are few or no intermediate forms indicate that evolution has not occurred .
this however just means that in this instance there are gaps in the fossil record because the fossils have not been found yet .
narby also points to the seemingly rapid appearance of species in the fossil record as an argument against evolution .
apparently narby has never heard of punctuated equilibrium .
narby stunningly also tries to argue that because large portions of dna is identical over many different species that this somehow indicates design , unfortunately for narby a lot of these identical sequences of dna code for the basic processes of life .
a human who could n't cope with oxygen or a fox which could not metabolize energy would not last long in this world .
the fact that these sequences are identical is actually a point for evolution because the same processes have been preserved and we even see similar basic skeletal structures in animals even when it is not efficient or useful such as digits in the fins of dolphins or the appendix in humans .
finally , we come back full circle to his argument about natural selection being a form of circular logic and he ties to paint evolution as unfalsifiable ( no , we can test it 's predictions in such fields as genetics and palaeontology ) and being denounce by an increasing number of scientists ( not at all true ) .
all in all while narby has some interesting nuggets of information and ideas in the cosmic serpent he ultimately seems to squander these ideas by jumping around in random directions and to strange conclusions based on very little evidence

while i have only read a limited selection of her work , in these essays , &quot ; against interpretation&quot ; being the ultimate example , sontag emerges as a simple-minded , arrogant ignoramus .
in her utterly unreasoned invective , sontag ignores ( or is just unable to understand ) two critical facts .
first , some works of art and theory are difficult to understand ( in varying degrees ) without the help of interpretation .
sontag 's flawed analysis of the supposed ruination of the works of kafka by interpretation demonstrates that not only is she among this crowd , she has clearly reached new and unheard of misguided heights .
second , sontag ignores the fact that works of art in other languages can not be understood in translation without the help of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language .
this could n't possibly be clearer than in poetry .
weinberger 's excellent &quot ; nineteen ways of looking at wang wei&quot ; , which adroitly considers the subject , had n't been released when sontag published this essay but it probably would n't have made a difference .
what was she thinking ?
the only good aspect of the essay ( and why i give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero ) is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy sontag 's writing

i stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck , all those millions reading gray 's franchise ca n't be wrong .
plus , i 've seen gray on larry king once , and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy .
this book , though , promising in its intro to be " sexy " , touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves .
now , i am not above accepting bedroom advice where it 's warranted ( for instance , it is thanks to dr. gray that i finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we 'd just went to see ) .
but gray 's generalizations , dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife bonnie were mostly unhelpful , and i suspect that the passages i found funny were involuntarily so .
although i 'm the first to admit that women love compliments , gray 's suggestions , as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say ( and , occasionally , what not to say ) were a tidbit too repetitive ( ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase " your breasts are wonderful " ?
read the book ! ) .
almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how , while getting to the undressing part , the man should pull the woman 's panties " up her crack " ( a.k.a .
give her a plain old wedgie--no joke ) .
and , do n't miss the one where the mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she 's in the mood and at half when she 's not ( or maybe it was different colors , i could n't read clearly through my tears--no offense to the mongolian people ! ) .
more annoying were the recurring ( and very stereotypical ) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man ( in various ways , be it foreplay , flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists ) , that a man always comes ( and too quickly , of course ) , and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom , or your ( otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire , i wonder ?
) approach will become a " turn-off " .
bottom line ( no pun intended ) : if you want some light and basic ( !
) guidance , the book is not too terrible , but if it is " advanced bedroom skills " ( gray said that !
) that you 're after , you 're better off digging out that old erica jong or even any pulp .

i have never read one of johansen 's books and after reading this one , i 'm not likely to read another .
i usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means , but i just could n't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing .
exclamations such as " dear heaven " and " lord " were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book , which does n't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone ( it would suit my southern grandma , however ) .
as another reviewer said , the big mystery of why daisy would n't leave geneva was n't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted jason to leave she could have just told him .
character development was lacking and i just did n't care that much about them .
i would have liked to hear more about cynthia and her antics .
i did finish the book because i was curious to know what happened , but i could n't wait for it to be over .
sorry , but this was not my cup of tea

...and dump it...great advice given in a previous review .
i think the " shame " about this book is that it glosses over some very interesting ideas with ( in my opinion ) some wholly unsupported and mostly un-related crap .
talbot is to the theory of the holographic universe what mark furman was to the guilt of oj simpson .
whatever truth there is to it will be hidden by his presentation of " false evidence "

the author has her narrator ( " cinnamon " ) spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship .
even though she 's calling the shots,as it 's her book , scarlett still comes out miles ahead .
perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as " ivanhoe " presents.the story may have been one-sided,but it 's the side mm chose to tell,and there 's kernel of truth in the " myth " of the old south,as in all myths .
margaret mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called " parody " ,which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-katie scarlett o'hara and the wonderful melanie wilkes.as if rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with scarlett.that 's why he turned to women like belle watling.and to imagine mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to ellen o'hara from ellen 's childhood.thank goodness this book is n't a pimple on the fanny of the classic gwtw,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.gwtw will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.i did n't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and i read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.i 'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.ludicrous and laughable-try again,ms randall,and try to get over the jealousy of scarlett and co. again,margaret mitchell need not fear,lol

i found this book extremely verbose and unorganized .
it would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student .
but it 's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class .
the authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student .
not recommended

for someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science , stephen jay gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book .
gould rambles on and on , attacking giants of modern science like samuel morton and francis galton , and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own .
gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class .
gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct .
for anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science .
stephen jay gould is a paleontologist ; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him , and it would be best if he , as well as all other crypto-marxists who wish to blend science and politics , stay out of it

this is the story of stingo , a 22 y/o aspiring writer in nyc in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers , sophie and nathan , at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship , falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction .
nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius .
sophie is a haunted polish survivor of auschwitz .
her story unfolds as she confides to nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the polish resistance , her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber .
while nathan and sophie are both fascinating , fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles , stingo , the narrator , is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to .
despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating , he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them , no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends ' tragedies , and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable .
the novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit .
the narrative style is foolishly ponderous , far over-written , especially in the first half .
and in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract , the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of nathan and sophie .
in the end , the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind : why did sophie so quickly choose eva to die rather than jan ?
a lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl ?
a blind panic ?
a preference for her son , the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose ?
it is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed sophie , and yet it 's glossed over in the narrative .
in fact , it 's followed by sophie and stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng ' as the novel would put it .
really ?
almost hard to believe sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations .
she uses sex to escape with her lover nathan , but it 's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade stingo relates .
could it be that styron only knows how to connect people through sex ?
how this could be considered one of the greatest american novels of all time is a mystery to me .
the potential is there , but only a truly talented , dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures

middle-aged gracie is a typical hollywood wife , right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe .
when her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage , gracie finds herself without love , without friends , and most importantly , without status .
( but at least she 's still got the money !
)

actually , most of what i know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish .
the plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it 's hard to follow .
the characters are taken straight from stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they 're impossible to relate to .
the writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly , lacking polish , wit , or interest .
especially irritating is grazer 's insistence on using gracie 's name as much as possible .
for example :

" gracie thought about it ; they 'd never been to marriage counseling .
gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome .
more or less her personality issues - the fact that gracie had too much personality .
gracie said and did pretty much what gracie pleased , in the beginning .
before gracie learned the way of the wife " ( p 38 ) .
i lost interest after about 20 pages , plowed my way through 40 more , then gave up .
it 's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography ( grazer/gracie ) and that as a hollywood wife , grazer does have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published .
definitely not worth your time

as the reviewer from jackhorn , ky stated , this book lacks original research .
if you read the section on the " house church movement " and then go to the website for the homechurch homepage , you will see that mr. wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his " research .
" for the many quotes he used from the website , not once were any of the authors contacted by mr. wolfe in order to do any original research .
if he had done so , he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book

as a professional , certified chef and baker , i am also an avid baking and cookbook collector .
after seeing that this book won and the james beard and the 'iacp cookbook of the year ' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too good to be true'-reviews on amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if peter reinhart is the jesus christ of bread- i finally decided to buy this expensive book .
what a dissappointment !
for all those blindly following reinhart as he were the saviour of true bread , wake up !
reinhart 's book is simply flawed .
compared to other bread books , it 's even a quite average book .
but one that is luxuriously packaged .
a lot of hot colorful expensive air .
and it 's expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it , but because of the super luxuriously editing .
this is a book for book enthousiasts , not for bakers , professional or home .
i see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools , as information and inspiration .
not as eye candy .
if you want nice pictures , buy an art book .
a book on baking bread with these awards behind it , should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques , original insights , an appetite for baking , factual info , the newest and tested developments in technique... what you get here is a fluffed up egotrip .
47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30-40 $ publishing hype .
do n't get me wrong : this is a beautiful , expensive book .
but one you do n't use in the kitchen , and certainly do n't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about .
but as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge , giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques , as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery , compared to other bread books , this book fails miserably info-wise .
but it has a snappy lay out .
jeff hamelmans 'bread , a book of techniques ' and rose beranbaums 'bread bible ' give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking .
they talk more about the subject 'bread' .
and not about themselves like peter reinhart clearly relishes .
mr reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in paris .
how about the bread info , the kneading , rising , baking , ingredient- and techniques info ?
i honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin .
bakers with such big ego 's that think that readers of a bread baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during 'a learning trip ' to professional bakers on which she accompanied him , than in another bread formula 's , should work in shobizz , not in a bakery or a culinary school .
big ego 's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry .
reinart is , judging by this book , sadly also one of them .
i do n't see in a 1000 years rose beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or jeff hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in paris .
mr.reinhart : your readers forked out 30-40 $ for bread info , not your personal travel experiences .
as you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil : stay with the subject !
and the subject of this book , for which i paid is 'bread and baking .
if we want to know about your personal life , we 'll read an interview in people , if they find you interesting enough .
peter reinharts 'the bread baker 's apprentice ' as a 'bread book ' is simply a marketing creation .
smartly edited , but way too short on substance .
there is not much new information on bread .
worse : there is not much info at all !
in total for 30-40 $ , you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by ten speed press , the editor or this book .
compared to beranbaums 640 pages , hamelmans 400 plus pages , that is a big difference for a big price .
with reinharts book , you get a lot of shining white surface that in other bread books is filled with bread info .
as a buyer of this book , you also pay for full page black-and-white and color pictures that are pure filler .
see p. 3 , 6 , 26... and why is the beautiful model fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr. reinhart himself or even ... bread alone ?
with reinharts next book they will no doubt put kate moss in an apron and a bakers vest .
package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30-40 $ .
never mind the content .
let 's talk a bit about the formula 's .
that should be an important part of a baking book , right ?
and they should be original and fine tuned , right ?
sadly to say : nothing new or original here .
some are n't even fine tuned .
and baking is all about fine tuning .
worse , almost all the formula 's can be found in other bread books .
and , most insulting for a buyer of this book , a lot of the mere 47 formulas ( reinhart uses this expensive word because 'recipe ' propably does n't fit into the marketing of this baking book ) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from reinharts former book 'crust and crumb' .
clever marketing and ba-da-bing !
by the way , 'crust and crumb ' has been reedited in 2006 .
at a fair price , i admit .
so if you want your dose of reinhart at a right price without the pomp , sc ï ¿ ½ nes of a marriage , without peter reinharts comment on the eiffel tower so to speak... buy 'crust and crumb ' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves .
but before i buy i would also first flip through beranbaums and hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the amazon shop .
as for this book , you should ask yourself : 'do i want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book ? ' .
taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews , as a baking book for the world market , this book is almost worthless .
the universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight .
like it or not , but that 's a fact .
you weigh your ingredients carefully by grams , kilo 's etc .
reinhart visited french top bakers poilane and gosselin , clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking .
i do n't think that poilane measures in cups and ounces !
but even then , let reinhart measure in cups for the home market .
but then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula 's itself for the rest of the world .
this guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic european inspired bread like ciabatta , fougasse... about a worldwide bread revolution !
and then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads : the same language , the metric weight system .
rose beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups/ounces .
it 's a simple as that .
bread is a world food , so use the world standard for baking .
if not , market your book mainly to the usa market and be honest and upfront about that .
and do n't give us that inflated hot air babble about a worldwide bread revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard , the metric wieght system !
this big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the usa .
the worldwide bread revolution wo n't be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide !
next point : reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast .
every baker worth his salt ( or yeast ) will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste , volume and texture .
yeast is a living organism .
as 'instant yeast ' it has been dried and put on the shelves for god knows how long .
it 's like you force a just woken up coma-patient , that has been dormant for months , years... to run a marathon .
fresh , pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant ' ( aka dried ) yeast .
try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home , and judge for yourself .
to place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments !
for scientific back up , you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist herve this 'molecular gastronomy , exploring the science of flavor ' ( columbia university press 2006 ) .
and it gets worse .
reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads .
if poilane hears this , he 'll drop dead !
every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening .
shortening produces a rancid/metallic taste and a slimy , unpleasant mouthfeel .
not to talk about health .
most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat .
read harvard 's nutrition professor walter willets book : 'eat , drink and be healthy ' ( free press 2001 ) .
new york has already picked this info up .
professional food writer and teacher reinhart has n't or does n't care .
for instance , reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil .
in italian bread !
come on , let 's be serious .
and this guy teaches at the culinary institute of america !
it 's like he is advocating spam to put on the bbq instead of beef !
if that is the standard of baking that reinhart uses , he 'll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a poilane .
then there is reinharts hygi ï ¿ ½ ne problem .
there is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the hazzard analysis of critical control points ( haccp ) .
reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the haccp by heart .
the first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns , is that before even touching ingredients , he must remove all the rings on his fingers .
because the place underneath a wedding band for instance , is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast .
and kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on , is not only very dangerous for the health of customers , it is simply not done for a baker .
i like my bread without filth baked in , thank you very much !
in the school where i earned my diplome in baking , if a student had a ring on during practical class , he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam .
yet we see professional teacher and bread book author reinhart kneading dough with his wedding band on !
see p. 36-37 , 82-83 , 255 , 245.. .
unforgivable in a 'professional ' baking book .
and all the more in an expensive book that won the james beard and iacp awards !
has anyone of the juries of the james beard foundation and the iacp , any basic knowledge of food hygiene ?
has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygi ï ¿ ½ ne in a so called 'professional bread book ' ?
one other thing , for a bread book that pretends to be world class , there is no word about gluten-free bread .
not one formula .
and this while more and more people are allergic to gluten ( protein in wheat flour ) .
to end on a positive note , one thing i found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book , was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread .
but , fellow reviewers , you can find all this info and more , and explained more clearly , more detailed and to the point , in hamelmans 'bread ' and beranbaums 'bread bible' .
and it does n't take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper .
peter , take out all the white empty space , learn to write more clearly and to the point , and you can say the same thing in 20 pages .
which leaves you 35 pages for more formula 's for example .
but if you have n't any formula 's left or are preparing a new book , then , yes , by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20 .
why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult , impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego ?
so despite all the hoopla , hyped reviews , near hysterical praise and important awards , this is simply a too expensive , show off-book .
it 's like the tale of 'the king with no clothes on' .
somebody has to yell : 'hey , wait a minute !
'

if you want good books on bread baking : buy one by jeff hamelman , rose beranbaum and bernard clayton .
you do n't get a model on the cover , but the content is all the better .
and in a bread book , is n't content more important than packaging

" this has been a story of an american soldier whose involvement in the making of the world 's greatest dictionary was singular , astonishing , memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad .
" - prologue .
well , that certainly could have been the story .
but what it was was a history of the dictionary ( as in " the history of the horse " ) with w.c. minor 's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so .
winchester , the author of several other books i 'll avoid , also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book .
so the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/alzeihmer 's , whatever you want to call what minor suffered .
whereas i should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it was n't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85 , i was fairly glad to see him go .

as a romantic comedy , star wars is a failure .
as a science fiction film , the annie hall is a complete disappointment .
whatever other merits these movies might have , there are definitely areas that they are lacking .
which brings me to the rough guide to cult movies : as a reference book , it is highly suspect .
what 's notable is that annie hall fails as sci-fi because it does n't try to be that genre ; the rough guide fails at the very category it aspires to .
which is too bad , because it is often an interesting read .
the failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so broad as to be meaningless .
we then a series of chapters representing various " genres " , some of which are valid ( science fiction , westerns , horror ) , some of which are ridiculous ( animals , food , nuns ) and some of which are not even true genres ( dubbed , independent , straight-to-video ) .
after this , we get various miscellaneous topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason , such as a list of top movie grosses followed by presidential movie trivia .
the movie descriptions are often amusing , although there are numerous errors ( such as misstating geoffrey rush 's role in pirates of the caribbean ) , even more omissions ( every reader will find his own ; one example is that unforgiven is missing from westerns ) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a specific genre to fill it out .
what saves this book is , even though it fails as a reference book , it is nonetheless entertaining .
i am therefore giving this two stars instead of one .
it 's a rather useless book , especially if you want to learn more about movies , but if you do pick it up , it is probably the most entertaining two-star book that you 're ever likely to read .

another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation.. .
if you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...unfortunately they do n't come with disclaimers .
like one would get when reading a book on the occult... people tend to go for books that support their bigoted view , and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it... .
it is a living .
when the da vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot 's guide to the code , how to interpret the code etc etc... .
i am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the ny times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad.. .

all i can say is pass me some aspirin .
this is a dozy of a bad novel .
as it says on the dust jacket , a supreme court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased .
its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit .
at the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence .
not only does he deal with his family , but his brothers friend , a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for .
and that 's only the start of the plot .
its really pretty bad , it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions .
the characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways .
baldacci is along with james patterson and dean koontz one of america 's worst authors .
if you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this , try one of harlan coben 's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character myron bolitar in it .
or for a more sophisticated read , look for denis lehane , he wrote the amazing mystic river , but his pi series located in boston is pretty good as well .

i must say that after reading this book , i am more confused than ever as to the origins of the war between japan and the us .
the book starts in 1936 , although most knowledgable people know that the march to war really began with the japanese seizure of manchuria in 1932 .
the author continually repeats the refrain that " americans do n't understand the japanese mentality and culture " , and it was this " misunderstanding " that led to the war .
it is true that toland defines the japanese term " gekokujo " as being some sort of " insubordination " that led to the kwantung army to feel it could move , presumably without orders from tokyo , into manchuria .
however , toland does not explain how this could happen .
there is little description of the power structure in japan , we do know that there was some attempt to create parliamentary democracy , but there were also the giant oligarchs who had much power , plus the military hierarchy .
somehow , the military took control in the 1930 's , but toland does n't really say how .
he describes in detail the " 2/26 " uprising of young officers in 1936 , and how they were willing to kill without compunction , and how fanatical they were , yet we are then told that they opposed expansion into china , and that the repression of this coup attempt would lead to an expanded war in china .
i must say i do n't understand this at all...toland potrays them as militaristic fanatics , yet they seem to be " the good guys " .
were n't those who supported expansion into china also militaristic fanatics ?
this is left totally unexplained .
toland then goes on to describe the fatal " incident at the marco polo bridge " in 1937 near peking ( beijing ) which led to the full-scale invasion of china .
toland says the government in tokyo , again , had nothing to do with it , in fact both the chinese and japanese commanders on the spot tried to calm things down , but some undefined " hotheads " ( possibly chinese communists ) kept inflaming the situation .
somehow ( without toland telling us how ) , a decision is made by someone ( not necessarily the " peace-loving " japanese prime minister prince konoye ) to mount a full-scale invasion of china .
an impression is left by toland that the chinese , particulary , the koumintang government of chiang kai-shek was provocative and unreasonable .
all i know is that
that marco polo bridge is within china , and it is understandable
that the chinese would resent the japanese military presence there .
after this , we move on to the atrocities of the " rape of nanking " , which again , according to toland , " somehow " happens , ( toland does admit that there were atrocities and between 200,000 and 300,000 chinese were butchered by their " brother asians " who claimed to be liberating them ( ? ) ) .
toland says the japanese commander at nanking did not order any such behavior , nor again , did the government in tokyo .
how then do thousands
of supposedly disciplined japanese troops suddenly get it into their heads to do such things ?
toland does n't give us a clue , other than his general statement that " westerners do n't understand the japanese " .
toland also , in a way , tries to claim that western opposition to japanese expansion into china was " hypocritical " because of western colonialism in east asia
( us in the philippines ; britain in hong kong , malaya , burma , india ; dutch in east indies ; french in indochina ) , however , by the 1930 's the us had already agreed to give the philippines
independence and the british were beginning to wind down the raj in india was setting up an autonomous indian government , so it was
apparent that colonialism was already on its way out before the war .
all this makes me wonder about the various things he says in the book , and i would look for a better source on the tragic history of this period .
i have read his books on the end of both world war i and world war ii which are much better , so that adds to my disappointment

the book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading .
if you do n't know anything about database marketing , then you will get something out of this book .
if you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis , loyalty programs and relationship marketing , there is nothing new here .
in fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is the loyalty effect by reichenheld or customer connections by wayland and cole .
the subtitle mentions the dot com world , but the book has little to say about the internet .
the book really does not cover crms ( as oppsed to database marketing ) in that it fails describe how crm systems work and what database , modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them

oh.... my... .
god ! ! ! !
there is another patricia kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind .
i thought one patricia was enough .
but after reading this book , i am faced with the frightening realization that there are two of them !
also , what i find very disturbing is that this version of patricia may be even daffier than the original version .
after reading just 6 or 7 pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of patriciaitis and a dose of kennealyism .
by the 40th page i was searching for my red slippers so i could click them together and get back to kansas .
or anywhere else , as long as my copy of this book did n't make the trip with me .
a pack of lies and a waste of paper and time .

this textbook is more useful for the flashy ( and admittedly very good ) teacher 's ancillaries .
but this review is not for the ancillaries .
it is for the text itself .
the text 's treatment of proofs is very cursory and not rigorous enough .
the diagrams for the algebraic problems are too confusing , compiling numerous different concepts into one problem .
while i agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another , it does n't make sense that most , instead of some , diagrams are over-complicated .
personally , i do n't like the format with the examples , mainly because it downplays the necessity for students to become literate in math , not just a good " example comparer .
" the text has little actual text to speak of .
i have not been teaching hs for very long , but i do not like this book .
i am not a textbook dependent teacher , but i do ( woefully ) recognize that students have poor study skills and do n't reference notes all the time .
i do not teach out of the textbook and i spend many hours planning lessons , lecture notes , my own examples , etc .
i had many complaints that the problems were confusing , included too many ideas at the same time , etc .
some may be successful in " teaching themselves " from the examples , but i am very disappointed that textbooks no longer have text .
i may be a math teacher , but i understand the importance of reading and how it helps a person to process the material .
on the other hand , the teacher resources is a great set of worksheets , study masters , note taking guides , etc .
perhaps the authors spent more time on those resources instead of the text .

the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again .
i was disappointed , soon after , when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts , with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing .
i mean graceland for a first date ?
i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights , and logan and nate from that same book .
none of them can talk in complete sentences .
and stella , who comes across as this loving mother , who puts her kids before anything else , works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she is n't there to oversee everything , even though the place has been successful for years .
there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband , she just does it .
unless , of course , it was in the last 50 pages which i did n't bother to read because i just could n't torture myself any longer .
and i 'm a big fan of roberts .
i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work .
but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be .
i 'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out .

ridiculous , convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring .
did cornwell even write this one herself ?
if so , she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread : on page 216 marino remembers mrs. paulsson greeting him at the door " wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater " , but later when he tells scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door .
perhaps it was the author 's attempt to let readers think marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened .
however , to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct

it claims to be a witty , thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who 's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way .

i liked most of jo beverly 's books .
in fact , she is one of my favorite romance writers .
that 's why it 's hard to believe she could write something so boring and contrived .
the premise -- saving an opium addict--- is good .
one could expect a lot of turmoil between the lovers .
but no -- it 's all pretty smooth .
the passion is tepid and not much else happens .
a series of " rogues " from previous books is paraded before the reader without really adding to the story .
and the conversations are so boring that i simply had to skip them .
i guess this may be enjoyable to new romance readers who do not know better or hard core beverly fans

how the other half lives was written over a century ago as an expose ' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of new york city .
the author speaks with a crusader 's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements , these streets , and these people as if they were living today .
this is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men , the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of new york city in the late 1800s .
he so graphically describes the filth , the sunless and airless rooms , the crowding , and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart .
riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people 's plight .
his pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery .
he , for the most part , blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions : " how shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man .
" ( p. 266 ) .
he laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor .
then , after his extensive discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions , something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers .
riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says , " if this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose .
" the author apparently succeeded with his purpose , because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us : " this book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major u. s .
cities .
"
how does this book relate to adult education ?
by moving chronologically from the founding of america to the slums of nyc in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ?
certainly riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem .
" thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more urgent because these people are poor , miserably poor almost to a man .
" ( p. 147 ) .
he does not forget that this " education " is not only for the poor people , but also for the wealthy landlords .
" clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant .
" ( p. 270 ) .
riis ' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity .
" it is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society .
" ( p. 233 ) .
the relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society .
although this book was exhaustive in its detail , it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening .
i found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that riis used for the different races .
in a sense it reads like a ginsberg poem ; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era .
read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm :
jewtown , bandit 's roost , double alley , the bowery , the bloody sixth ward , the fourth , fifth and tenth wards , blindman 's alley , the bend , the battery , little italy , the french quarter , hell 's kitchen , the west side , bottle alley , frog hollow , poverty gap , murderer 's alley , gotham court , the old brewery , old africa , potter 's field , blackwell 's island asylum , rogues ' gallery , penitentiary row , chinatown .
the list goes on .
to someone reared in rural america , this chant sounds like a song about another country .
riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of new york city :
chinaman ( he ca n't be taught ) , ( chinese ( coolie--laundry business ) , polish jew ( coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling ) , russian jew , jew ( money is their god ) , bohemian ( poor , but thrifty ) , blacks ( like to gamble , but they are clean ) , greek , hebrews ( tailors , all of them ) , dutchman , irish ( like to drink and have expensive funerals ) , german ( order loving ) , swiss , pasquales , russian , italian ( a born gambler ; lighthearted and gay ) , swamp angel ( thieves ) , street arabs ( army of homeless boys ) , tramps and toughs ( the world owes them a living ) ,and the celtics .
i was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and riis ' comments about every race .
i noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day .
riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday .
i hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days .
does every generation think that is happening in their time ?
not only should this book be used by people researching new york city ` s tenements , but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change .
it is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man 's greed overrides his concern for human dignity .

i recently read " i " , " k " , and " l " in succession .
compared to " innocent " and " killer " , i found lawless to be slow paced ( even though this edition finds kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country ) and the plot twists less surprising .
with others i 've read in the series , i am usually hooked relatively early in the story line .
i was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome .
even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing ( kinsey has little contact with immediate family , ergo she substitutes others in her life--henry , rosie , pitt family , the criminal elements in this book--as her family... ) .
i also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in " l " could be so dim-witted on one page , and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next .
anyway , there are others in this series i would recommend more highly ( " m " being one of them )

the author uses a lot of technical vocabulary and is rather repetitious .
although i understood what mcphee was talking about most of the time , i think it would have made a better film documentary than a book .
the author constantly went off on tangents and the overal organization of the book did not appeal to me at all .

samantha seems a lot like becky .
a young woman whose life is very out of balance and does n't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions .
instead of staying at the firm and working out her " mistake , " she runs away .
this is just like becky hiding her bills .
and then she gets a totally implausible job , because she ca n't tell the truth - again like becky .
samantha does n't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to .
i agree that the firm would never have taken her back ; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care .
samatha , like becky at times , seems somewhat manic , in that she 's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation .
just like becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared .

" i would n't dare tell someone with aids or a refuge or whomever that their only enemy is their own fears , and even for others such overpersonalization does n't work .

the first book of auster 's new york trilogy was originally published in 1985 , and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel .
i 've never read the original ( or any of the other parts of the trilogy ) , so i ca n't comment on karasik and mazzicchelli 's adaptation .
however , i can say that since i 'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature ( those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for auster 's story ) , this really did n't do anything for me at all .
the story is basically an exercise in metafiction , and if you like that stuff , great -- i do not .
it is dressed up ( at least initially ) in the mystery genre , but that 's just window dressing .
( there 's a long legacy , especially in france , of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings ( for example alain robbe-grillet 's two books the erasers and the voyeur , or the films of jean-pierre melville .
)

the story begins fairly straightforwardly : a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named daniel quinn lives in new york on his own since the death of his wife and son .
a complete stranger calls him and thinks quinn is a private detective named paul auster and begs him to to take his case .
( the writer paul auster , and his family , shows up for one scene -- it 's that kind of book .
) quinn meets with the strange man , who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father , who was seeking to discover the true language of god .
the father has been released from jail and quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report .
everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he 's been following , and his clients .
he spends several months watching the building and going crazy .
once he realizes they 've disappeared , he finds his own life has disappeared as well .
obviously this is all somewhat about identity , but it 's more about fun stuff like language , representation , and other tiresome postmodern subjects ( as are the other two parts of the trilogy , which involve a man spying on someone , and yet another disappearance ) .
it has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world auster has thrust his characters into .
the simple , heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material , especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic .
however , if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters , this is probably not for you .
fans of auster may enjoy this , but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen .

paul auster 's city of glass is perhaps the worst read i 've experienced .
the story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious ; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself ; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--i kid you not .
the best part of this novel is the end .
i read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid ; however , i was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams .
to all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical , existential tour de-force , i beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ .
i believe the author had no such thoughts in mind , had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining , dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices , gather such literary praise .
like a rorschach image you can see life , love , death , a myriad of wonderful symbols , and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth , intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life , well , then , good for you .
but in reality , the person that made that rorschach for you is auster , and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you all bought it...hook line and sinker .
this novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere , show us little on the way and still receive praise , despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work , in that it plain and simply : sucks

i bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects , and given most other people 's ratings , i decided to give it a try .
however , upon opening the book my first thought was , " these all look like high school yearbook photos " , which is exacltly what they are .
it seems that that 's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market .
his main concern , which he stresses throughout the book , is creating a " saleable picture " , and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom , since she 's usually the one with final say over the pictures .
a better title for this book would have been , " how to take high school senior pictures " .
even then , most of the pictures are not very good , both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book .
in addition , the poses are unnatural and awkward looking , and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors .
to be fair , the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject , but there is really very little useful information here .
so , if you 're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a sears portrait , this may be the book for you .
however , if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner , i 'd steer clear of this book

ehrman 's work is not for a person of faith .
it does not take faith into consideration .
it is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available - most forged and falsified ; and none which can be validated .
i read it as an immediate follow-up to his work " lost scriptures " - books that did not make it into the new testament .
i was warned by my minister who is also a bible scholar and has two ph.d. 's - and my minister was correct .
in lost christianities , ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the new testament by implying that many new testament books may be false , forged , translated incorrectly , altered to serve a purpose , etc... ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the new testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the new testament .
ehrman 's lost christianities starts out strong , but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader .
if for nothing else , it is an attempt to test your faith , but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith .
the book leads one to believe that the author is as much a bible critic as he claims to be a scholar .
he does present all sides of the new testament story and it is interesting how the new testament was formed .
however , the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does .
to save you the time and money , simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the new testament and how came to be .
ehrman and other bible critics ( ie. , the devinci code ) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the new testament story .
save your money and give it to your church instead .

i 'm a conan doyle fan and found the alienist to be a pretty good read , so i made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside .
carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it .
the dialogue is flat , the plot uncompelling and carr relies on the near-endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement ! ! !
into this tale , which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because i could n't bear to read the mangled sentences .
this book has no climax -- just , thankfully , an ending .

well , suffice to say this will never get any space with my other books as it is very poorly put together .
flimsy cover , flimsy pages , it 's put together about as well as a children 's coloring book .
i too was fooled by the default picture , i thought it was a nice hard cover with a bookmark ribbon like other " religious " texts .
nothing could be further from the truth .
hey amazon , change the default picture to the one which shows the book as is , a flimsy cover with a picture of a hard cover on it

nansook hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to hyojin moon , but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents ' machinations to get her married into the moon family .
eyewitnesses tell of nansook visiting the moon household and knowing full well of hyojin 's excesses in advance of her marriage .
the hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the moon family , and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first moon daughter , they pushed nansook to marry a moon son .
though i do n't know all the motives , the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that ms. hong has not been honest about .
it is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of rev moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect , given her own deceit

normally , i find it hard to put a sue grafton book down once i get started .
not the case with " s " .
i did not enjoy the plot about violet and her abusive husand .
the main character violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs , red hair , just a boozing slut over all .
i did n't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her .
the ending was n't clear either .
i did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades .
most of the characters just were n't that interesting overall .
i missed her interactions with rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor , the handsome 80 year old baker henry .
usually , there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here .
i would vote pass on this one .

so , being a fan of all forms of literature , more specifically challenging [ faulkner ] , pretentious [ d.h. lawrence ] and original [ kafka ] works , i was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what 's considered pynchon 's most imporant work .
important 40 years ago , perhaps , but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one .
oh man , the radio station is kcuf , boy , that 's incredibly clever , i bet it 's , like , something spelled backwards .
i fully understand what pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work , to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs , among other things , all while giving us a story with no particular plot , no moral , no message .
i can understand it , but it does n't mean it 's worth my time , i did n't even finish it .
i read about half and then just dropped it to the floor .
i 've read in numerous reviews of haruki murakami 's work that he 's a latter day , japanese , pynchon .
i do n't agree , murakami 's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing , pynchon is a hack

this smugly-edited series has become a dreary example of careerist nepotism and features mainly short stories with linebreaks and jokey poems that are not funny .
some choice awful lines :

denise duhamel : " do n't give into your cravings , you need to stay lean / so you can lift up your skirt as you prance and twirl... "

kim addonizio : " better dead then fed .
/ he who laughs will not last .
/ sticks and stones will break you , "

thomas lux : " that the eyes be gouged out / and replaced by hot coals / in the head , _the blockhead_,/ of each countrymen or woman who , / upon reaching their majority , / has yet to read moby dick... "

most of the poems herein , besides franz wright and paul violi among a scattered few , would have been better off as just titles than full poems .
the big name poets featured have generally written better poems , the younger poets all seem to have some connection to the new school .
it 's incredibly disappointing : the best american poetry 2006 could have been so much more .
instead , * it 's * a joke

i thought this book was going to be a great legal thriller , but little did i know that it would turn out to be the worst book i have ever read .
i expected a lot more out of scott turow , who wrote " one l " , which i loved , but this book was plan boring .
the begining started out slow and it never picked up from there !
the worst legal thriller , ever

from about the second page of this book , i was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it .
the characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another .
add to that the stereotypical characters ( the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys , the women are all " large-assed " or fat with the exception of ella ) .
and the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters ' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb , not to mention kind of repulsive ( i like a good sex scene as much as the next person , but tuck 's descriptions are completely banal ) .
oh wait , there 's more .
the spanish is atrocious .
it 's hard to believe that tuck had a translator for this book .
it 's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks spanish .
half the names are grammatically incorrect .
many of the words are just plain wrong ( " vita " means life in italian , not spanish , for starters ) .
i felt embarrased for the author .
does she know that her book is full of errors ?
the one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is : shallow .
i sincerely hope that readers do n't mistake this book for historical fiction .
the author clearly knows little about paraguay and its people and history , and clearly does n't care , from her superficial treatment of it .

i agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long .
genetic algorithms are a great programming tool , and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately , but this book had a lot of redundant information .
if you are interested in using ga for solution-finding , i doubt you 'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so .
many of the examples later in the book were so specific that i could n't see how they could be usefully generalized .
really optimizing a ga approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning , and this book wo n't help much with that .
i think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book .

i agree completely with the becksted review ( i also noted that it was helpful , but i meant it would have been helpful had i read it before i bought the cd ) .
this refers to the cd version .
i did listen all the way to the end , i kept thinking there was going to be something , but continued to be disappointed .
i found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness ( evaluating someone 's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it ?
)

it seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to " integrity " in this day and age , but frankly this book did n't help me much .

yes , it was intended as a " fun " read ( literature of the absurd ?
) and it did evoke several chuckles , especially at the first .
but as literature ( read into that word what you will ) it 's an abysmal failure .
crammed with so many jokes , puns , outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action , one 's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices .
it 's a case where you ca n't see the forest for all the intervening trees .
i had expected a " straight " tale similar to the alienist .
then when i discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural i perked up .
it was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that i grew weary of the whole thing .
toward the end it descended into caricature .
what 's sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to snl and the visual media .
in fact , the book seemed very visual , almost as if the author were transcribing a snl skit

i 've read most of the books written by greg iles .
i liked them all except dead sleep , which by the way was much better than this one !
anyway , despite dead sleep , if i see a book by this author i have n't read yet i 'd grab them right away without further thinking because i enjoyed the rest of his work very much .
so , when i bought sleep no more i was prepared to stay up all night because i was certain it would be thrilling .
wrong !
the whole mallory/eve/cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though i set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests .
i still laugh when i think of the explanation of how mallory gets into another person ( she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm ) .
i should give greg iles some credit for this idea , a stupid one , but creative nonetheless .
as for the characters , i was so appalled by the paranormal plot that i could n't care less about any of them .
i read the quiet game and liked it , but the appearance of penn cage was just so blah because he 's like a cameo in this book and did n't have a character development nor adds anything to this book .
in conclusion , i would not recommend this , especially to those who liked other books by greg iles .
nevertheless , i 'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because i enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers .

this book is poorly written .
although it is one of the most update-to-date versions out ther , it seems muddled and repetitive .
i was surprised at the number of grammatical mistakes and errors .
clearly little time was spent editing this book .
i 'm not sure how it got to be a new york times bestseller , outside of the fact that it is related to harry potter .
i 'd advise going with a different biography

by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit pollard 's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might .
and while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion , ( i.e .
swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century ) pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of christian virtue .
this is basically saying christians have lost a culture war without explaining why .
while the initial exposition on what the parameters of christian modesty mean pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of christian modesty would be .
furthermore , when push comes to shove he refers to the westminster larger catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused .
some of his cases are self-defeating .
on one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century .
props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting .
on the other hand , it 's cheap so if you 're not persuaded the research has been effective it wo n't cost you much

hunt this book down .
read " the bet " ( pp .
131-134 ) .
put this book down .
leave the store satisified knowing that you have read the only humorous story in this collection .
sure you could read some other stories in the book , but they 're so terribly unfunny that you will invariably come to hate yourself and everyone around you for being in a store that carries this dreadful book .
the only way these stories could possibly be funny is if they were somehow adapted for a series of snl skits , in which mcsweeney 's unfunniness were somehow reversed by the lens of snl 's unfunniness .
come to think of it , this book is just as awful as snl , except that you ca n't change the channel .
you 're just stuck there on the subway wishing you 'd picked up that am metro , desperately trying the read the wall street journal ( or even the daily news ) over the shoulder of the person next to you .
anything - just anything - to avoid the tears of boredom that come from reading this garbage .
so , if you like late-model snl and you can read , you may like this .
but i doubt it

personally i found this book to be little more than a gre verbal refresher course .
sure , it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing .
i think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of , well , then , does this really matter ?
in my opinion i feel this is what the author has done .
i was really disappointed in this book

this book may be as well called " the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls " .
the author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories .

the book claims to help you :

1 .
say goodbye to aching joints , sagging skin and fatigue
2 .
improve the quality and function of the genetic material in your cells
3 .
ramp up your body 's self-repair functions
4 .
increase your stamina , endurance and sex drive
5 .
dramatically improve your resistance to disease , including cancers
6 .
have more youthful , radiant skin

you do n't need to be a cynic to be able to tell that the claims are all inflated .
sure , you 'll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle , but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet , some of the tips on progressing further to " genetic repair " will sound a bit too good to be true .
in fact , most of the advice and recommendations given in the book are not very different from that found in many other books on nutrition and supplement .
the authors just gave all the info a " dna twist " .
i stopped reading the book a few chapters from the end when it begins to talk about hormonal supplementation and some glowing testimonial on the author 's services .
all " natural " ?
no side effects ?
how long have the subjects been followed up and how long have physicians really practised hormonal therapy on otherwise healthy individuals ?
the results may be real , but how safe is it for the rest of subject 's life ?
sounds like another one of those practice-promoting books in this genre .
disappointing

to anyone who has or is planning on reading this book , consider this .
this book has a lot of words which feel good and can make anyone 's guilty conscience ease in thinking that " your own will is god 's own will .
" ( quoted from walsh 's books ) if you will it , then god wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom , right ?
will is a precursor to action .
if there is no such this an a 'right ' or 'wrong ' will , then in essence there is really no such thing as a 'right ' or 'wrong ' action .
if someone else 's actions hurt you , you feel that action is wrong .
but the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way , right ?
it was his will , therefore he was justified and right and god 's right there to back him up .
the victim is suffering .
where is his god when he needs him ?
was the victim correct in believing the action wrong ?
was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right ?
in this book , god says that we have the authority to decide what is right or wrong .
the action is both right and wrong , right ?
wrong .
this is when you may want to take a look at the bible .
the bible portrays god as a loving yet holy god .
holy is defined as exalted or worthy of complete devotion as one perfect in goodness and righteousness .
he loves us but sees a real and distinct right and wrong as clear as day where sometimes it appears to be a tangled mass to our limited senses .
he created us and gave us a conscience which can in most cases discern a right and wrong in a situation .
he gave us a free will which allows us to then choose that right or wrong .
are we always going to do the right thing ?
no , and he knows that .
when we do wrong thing , it is unhealthy at best to believe that doing wrong is the right thing to do because we desire it .
we 're not god .
we do wrong all the time and god simply wants us to acknowledge this .
he wants us to exercise our freewill to do right according to our conscience and what 's told in his book .
but he knows that even still we will do wrong when attempting in good faith to do right .
and that is why in a generous act of sacrificing love he sent his son jesus christ to show us the way , sacrifice himself on the cross for our wrongs , and be there still today to forgive our wrongs when we believe in him and in the truly amazing thing he did for us .
it 's a beautiful thing !
i urge you to believe that the holy bible is not a lie and jesus christ simply did the things the book said he did and is the person he claimed to be .
11 disciples took everything they said and wrote to their grave and never recanted even after much persecution .
wow !
i 've been a believer in christ for almost seven years and he 's continued to worked wonders in my life .
i would have been a fan of these books if god had not put me on his path .
in case you 're wondering , i gave this book 2 stars because it has reinforced my faith in christ by giving a glaring example of what god is not .
if you 've read through all of this , thank you .
i encourage you to write me .
god bless !

my almost-6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi-pronged approach , including things like supplements , a gfcf diet , and ot/pt/speech .
after a year on the gfcf diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors , we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies .
our close friends ' daughter , now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism , took a similar approach , but even more strict , following the dan protocol as well as the recommendations of this book , including chelation , a dizzying array of supplements , gfcf diet , ot/pt/speech , aba , etc .
while our child has made tremenous advances , or friends ' child has not , beyond minor advances related to her age--at 4 , she is still non-verbal , far from potty trained , exhibits many repetitive behaviors , and needs constant verbal and visual cues for the simplest tasks .
the point i am trying to make is that every child is different and no one , no one has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a significant percentage of children with autism .
autism , as most of you likely know well , is a catch-all term .
our friends ' daughter no doubt has a very different kind of pathology than ours .
i have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action , rather than immediately launching into predictions of one " cure " for a broad range of issues .
while i do think some of what the author recommends can be helpful ( and it really may offer a tremendous help for some children with autism ) , some of the therapies ( like chelation ) can be very dangerous--in fact , i have yet to see one of the many families who tried chelation therapy see * any * improvement in their child 's symptoms .
i have seen more success with gfcf diets ( for a small percentage of children ) , but the greatest success seems to come with comprehensive behavioral therapy .
i certainly understand where families are coming from--i have been there myself , but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to " cure " them with multiple substances that have had very little study/peer review in a desperate frenzy of worry is both dangerous to their bodies and destructive to their emotions .
as with anything , balance is your approach will serve you and your child well .

.... you can get all three of these wacky books in one neat volume !
does n't this hurt the bottom line at hagee ministries ?
what , has the pool of his mesmerized followers begun to dry up ?
it reminds me of when the band , kiss ( aka kings in satan 's service ) re-packaged their first three albums as " the originals .
" at least in that case you had an extra track of " rock and roll all nite " , assuming you already had the album " dressed to kill .
" on the other hand , maybe hagee ministries was using the kiss model , assuming that it would n't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy , compact volume of fear

i 'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read " grapes of wrath " or " east of eden .
" instead i have focused on " of mice and men " and his lesser known works , such as " to a god unknown " and , my personal favorite , " pastures of heaven .
" i 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular .
when i began reading " in dubious battle , " it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck 's work .
telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac , it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac 's radical cell .
there is a great ( and misleading ) sense of intrigue - mac and jim travel by boxcar , work secretly through letters , go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers .
early on , the pace is fast , exciting , and engaging .
suddenly , steinbeck simply fails to deliver , leaving the reader wondering when he 's going to pick up the pace again .
after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker 's strike , i expected the sense of excitement to continue .
it simply never does .
summary of " in dubious battle " - workers get mad .
workers get tired .
workers get mad .
workers get tired .
workers get mad .
workers get tired .
the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking .
and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first , they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book .
most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration , and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense.. .

...and eating .
steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story , because at least a good 25 % of the story concerns finding , eating , and ( worst of all ) talking about food .
there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story , but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment , discussing whatever comes to mind .
steinbeck 's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters .
but i advise any reader of " in dubious battle " to take this course - after the strike is initiated , simply set the book down .
you wo n't miss anything .
nothing of great import happens , and only a very few memorable characters ever surface , and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces .
i suppose now i 'll give " grapes of wrath " a go .
perhaps if it is n't one of his " greats , " it is n't worth reading

this is the sort of book you get when an author writes on a subject with which he has only a passing familiarity , and lacks the confidence that the subject matter is inherently interesting enough to hold the reader 's attention .
the result is a book that is ultimately unsatisfying .
one symptom of the problems described above is that large portions are devoted to subjects other than money .
for example , the author uses the first three pages after the introduction to describe aztec ritual sacrifice in literally gory detail before proceeding on to the use of cocao beans as commodity money .
i think that 's meant to be what they used to call in show business a " grabber , " but for the reader expecting to learn about money , it 's a distraction .
another problem is that the author 's grasp of modern economics is shaky at best , and especially in the latter part of the book , he 'll make a point and then repeat himself , much as an undergraduate trying to extend the length of a term paper that 's run a few pages short .
and yet , there 's also some interesting and oddly convincing tidbits of information here .
the author states that l. frank baum 's 1900 book " the wizard of oz " is really a parable about the need for a bimetallic dollar based on both gold and silver .
but even as it strikes you that this is an interesting bit of trivia , you realize that it 's only a bit of trivia and has little larger significance .
if you 're looking for a economic history of money , you should look elsewhere .
if you 're interested in the cultural and sociological impact of money , this may be more to your liking , though i think it still falls short .

when i traveled in japan with a friend , this was the book we brought with us .
within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in tokyo looking for a better one .
there are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country , and the advice to get a jr pass was invaluable .
however , the book has a very negative , immature view of japan as a country and travel in general .
it seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade .
did i pay $ 1200 for plane tickets to go drink with americans ?
the authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites , ancient and modern , that borders on the anti-intellectual .
the cultural notes are dated , inaccurate , and shallow .
after a while , we began to think , " if lonely planet does n't recommend it , it 's probably interesting .
" the maps , as many have mentioned , are almost useless .
ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path , it 's practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas .
there are much better guides available .
this entry has sworn me off the lp series for life .

this is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when " a yarn " was n't an archaic term .
does it give some helpful hints ?
sure , there 's the obvious ones like show do n't tell and all characters have free will .
but fiction has changed a lot since henry james ( thankfully ) , and this book might be better left unread .
plus , i do n't buy the " only people who are n't well-read do n't like it " argument .
i 've read nearly all the books mentioned and i still wish i never bought this book

i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well .
i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story .
this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative .
and this is exactly what " insomnia " is .
this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read sep. 10 , 1990- nov 10 , 1993- three years in which king took to write this book .
three years which were evidently wasted .
the other king books i 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification .
" insomnia 's " ralph roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with .
he is strong , kind , has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable .
his counterpart lois chasse does n't come across as identifiable .
instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with ralph .
king does n't usually do that with his secondary characters .
other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable , like ed and helen deepenau , the three bald doctors , and ralph 's numerous confidantes .
then there 's the whole abortion mess .
this central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story .
though king does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via detective leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device .
i gave the book two stars because i am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal .
the devices were obvious and all thru the reading i asked myself , 'how is king going to get through this ?
' his weapon of choice was most often ralph robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance .
it seemed whenever king was in trouble in the story , he would use ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him .
this is a useful tool for a beginning writer , but king used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning .
one last thing , the villians just do n't work .
they are not frightening , they are not demonic , they are not vicious or malign .
three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors ?
their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone ?
the real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness .
then there 's the crimson king , the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a catfish in one of the most terrible , anti-climactic scenes ever rendered .
i rest my case .

while easy enough to read , if the exact same pages were enclosed in a harlequin romance cover , i would n't know the difference .
i 'm extremely surprised this is a " best seller " .
maybe i should take up writing because i ca n't possibly be worse than this .
ok , it 's a good enough story but wow , it 's predictible and boring .
i read it completely in 2 days , and i 'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while .

steer clear of this one - criticizing others for lack of original thought or a consistent viewpoint , while virtually copying their cover ( not to mention riding the wave of their unique concept ) illustrates the weak and timid position assumed by this author .
please achieve your own significance , not bashing others popular and widely accepted readership .
as christians , we are obviously aware of varying theories on end-times .
to even slightly indicate we are not aware indicates the authors pompous platform .
so sad his approach could n't be based on his own original work

after reviewing the book further i realized it was like touched by an angel , and i do n't like that show at all , but i decided to read it anyway cause it looked good .
that was a mistake , the character 's were two dimensional and truly unbelieveable .
in the first story - rainmaker - the professor was sooo in love with hailey he did n't care about getting killed or putting his own child 's life in danger - come on now .
he would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows .
i did n't even read the second story , maybe i 'll come back to that .
the third story was totally ridiculous as well .
paris is so sick of russell - he does n't have a job , money and no ambition , yet she stays with him .
he cheats on her , she has the broads up in her house and sells them mary kay ! !
yet she stays with him .
he has given her an std ! ! !
she stays with him ! ! !
she does n't even like making love to him .
during all of this nonsense her fi-one boss is pushing up on her , and she resists .
she wo n't cheat on her man .
what ! ! ! !
if you like reading fairy tales then this is the book for you .
for everyone else who likes a little believable drama in their fiction - do not get this book !

bought this book hoping for a comprehensive resource of information on hiring a nanny .
boy were we disappointed .
as was mentioned in another post - the book is nothing more than a glorified outline , and half of the book is copies of the forms that are on the disk , which forms by the way are in .pdf form and are not even fillable .

i found this book to be full of silly metaphors ( as if that 's the only way we could relate to dr. twerski ) .
it just did n't get me the information i needed .
perhaps others would find it motivational

this books seems interesting until you learn ( within a few pages ) that the author forbids masturbation at any time and basically sees sex as a crude animal instinct .
if you 're a big bill bennett fan you might enjoy this , but for those inerested in developing a little more restraint while still participating to some small degree in modernity , look elsewhere .
btw , mr. o'reilly , the world is not a more brutish place than ever before .
sad , to say , it 's almost certainly less so .

i agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told .
there is no excitement in describing the stages .
they are just wrapped up all of a sudden .
to me , it did not seem like the author did many interviews of his own .
it seems like he just watched the tour de france and retold what he saw on the broadcast .
his supposed " back-stories " which should be really interesting , all seem like a recap of the mini segments during the tour broadcast that let you know more about the participants .
there is just nothing that reaches out and grabs you , and makes you want to keep reading .
i finally quit it after the poor description of the day in the pyrenees .
that is one of the most exciting stages of the race , and the narrative was so wooden

i 'll be the first to admit that i 'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels .
it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it .
this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book .
it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle .
but the result is a less satisfying book .
it skims rather than digs deep

</review_text>
<review_text>

trash sells and this is the definition of trash .
unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction .
shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research .
readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write

i have read all of the scarpetta novels through the last precinct , and i have never wanted hours of my life back as i did when i finished the last precinct .
cornwell tried to go in a new direction with her writing , and it failed .
if kay scarpetta was a fortune teller , this book may have been alright.. .
what i mean by that is , in at least 2-3 separate occassions in this book , kay says " i had a feeling i knew exactly what [ so in so was going to say/do to me... "
really kay ?
out of absolutely nowhere , you just believe that the unusual way marino has been acting is due to the fact that you are going to be prosecuted by a special grand jury for homicide even though nothing led up to your supposed " revelation .
" you are truly impressive .
reading this book makes me want to steer clear of blowfly and trace , but then again , maybe cornwell read some reviews and saw that she had to shape up .
this book really ticked me off and i would n't recommend it to an enemy

how some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me .
first of all , i 'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first !
secondly , if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it !
this book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section .
horrible !
so basically , this introduction to electronics does n't do a lot of introducing you to anything !
i 'm on transistors right now , and i 've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the internet , and guess what ?
it 's using schematics i do n't understand , and yet again i 'm going to have to do more looking on the net .
this book is not worth it .
do n't buy it !
just please , for your own sake , find another one .
also , half the book is dedicated to projects .
that is , actually building electronic circuits !
why did n't the author just entitle this , " how to build electronic devices " , then ?
it 's beyond me !
as far as explaining things are concerned , the book does very little , and assume you know more than you do .
unfortunately i 'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook , because this one is just horrible .
i was really wanting to learn something from this book , but it 's just not happening .
for every chapter i 've read on this book i 've had to do research on the net , and i 'm sick of it .
i 'm on pg .
154 , and i 'm closing it .
do not buy this book !
i 've already found a better book on amazon.com ( just buy reading the table of contents ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
) and i 'm going to get it !

this book is by far the worst proofed book i 've ever read in my life .
i ca n't believe i 'm writing this as a review , because i can normally overlook a few typos .

i do n't own this book nor have i read it , but if that first sentence is any indication of the quality of writing , i wo n't ever .
it is not a sentence .
one would think you would save your non-sentences for someplace else in a book , not start off with one , giving your readers the impression that you are all hat and no cattle before you even make your points

this book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society .
we can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to .
while wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate , his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling " sorry for them "

i am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review .
however , after reading botox diaries , i felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull , trite , and disjointed .
i love my " chick-lit " books , but botox diaries is a disgrace to this genre .
the plot is weak and unrealistic ( even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords " lite & fun " books ) .
the plot is also disjointed , perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book .
the characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull .
botox diaries is absolutely the worst book i have ever read .
-- december 2005 update : my friend insisted on reading this book ( ugh...despite my warnings ! ) .
even though she was stuck in the airport for eight hours , she still could n't bear to finish the book , because she found it so dull .
she actually left it , half-read , at the airport

this is perhaps the most disappointing king book i have ever read ( and considering that i have read " desperation " and " insomnia " that is saying a lot ) .
the storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story .
i have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top .
the only thing i found interesting about king as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book .
i thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book .
i would guess that anybody that reaches song of susannah has read is a faithful reader of king and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works ( which as of late have been bad with the exception of " the green mile : hey , steve , if i wanted to read an infomercial i 'll read my junk mail .
i can not wait to read the last dark tower book so i can be put out of my misery

of all the textbooks i 've had , from elementary school through graduate school , this is easily the worst one i 've ever had , for any course .
first of all , the authors so redundantly use the word " whilst " and the phrase " rules of the game " that it really gets on your nerves .
my classmates all agree with me on this point .
second , speaking of getting on your nerves , half of what these authors say is , " ...as we talked about in the previous chapter " or " as we 'll talk about in the next chapter " .
there is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25 % of its size , and hell , it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course .
third , the authors should win a pulitzer prize for flowery language .
they seem more interested in impressing me than educating me .
their sentences are far too long .
they do n't know the meaning of clear and concise , and i think they should all go back to english composition 101 .
they 'd be great politicians , because never have i heard anyone say so much and yet say so little....over and over and over again .
the book is a like an inflated academic paper...and it 's boring .
if ever a topic begged for a case-study approach , it 's this one , and this book is not the answer .
save your money , and beg your instructor not to use this text .

after reading the first book * ( which was catastropha ) and reading the second which was really good , i thought that the series is taking off , i was mistaken , the third book is slow , and boring , you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that series

nothing much is happening , and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas , the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find ( and better written as well ) in dragon lance series , or other adventure books , also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books ,

reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book , which some say is very boring
i guess this is where the adventure end for me. .

have you ever met a person where every single thing that happens to them is a spiritual awakening ?
the kind of person that ca n't go to the bathroom without making some sort of journal entry of the new vistas they discovered ?
well that is the kind of mentality you get with this book .
you ca n't simply look at a sunset and be in awe of nature or god .
no you need to relate to it and make it a part of you .
i am avery spiritual person and love traveling .
i have traveled all over the world and feel complete when i do so .
reading this book did the one thing i never thought was possible , it put me off of traveling .
fortunately , the feeling passed quickly .
i will not make little travel shrines .
i will not take little spiritual trips across my living room .
i will not follow this persons advice .
and this book is going nowhere near my rucksack .
sorry , i am too stoic for this book .
i would recommend people read books about the places they want to go .
learn their culture and a little bit of their language .
do n't worry about the trip just go on it .
my passport is the only material possession i truly value .

i much prefer the lillian jackson braun " cat " books , at least there is some humor , and i like the " mystery " part of these books better than deaver 's .

i admit i was impressed by the table of contents of this book , and i admit i had no previous experience with the subject , but sure with the 'real life ' of support services for a database company .
most of the book is devoted to review commercial software available on the market and for me , this is just enough to be dissapointed .
there are better commercial magazines or even websites can provide you this information for free.. .
although some formulas and templates looks very interesting ( that 's why 2 stars ) , maybe should you consider a help desk book instead

like most critics of objectivism , mr. walker focuses his criticism on ayn rand 's frailties and idiosyncrasies rather than the principles of the philosophy she founded .
my disappointment in his book was immediate and i have to say it 's as unoriginal a piece of writing as any other critic i 've read .
his cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things objectivism is obvious to anyone who takes ideas seriously .
i can not recommend this book even to those interested in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy ; this book was written for those of like mind to the author...whatever mind they can be said to have .
the body and scope of work done by objectivist scholars who 've never met ayn rand now ellipses her work - both fiction and non-fiction - and the work of her original core of thinkers .
to characterize the movement as a cult may have had some validity in the years prior to her death , but only in the most remote sense of the word .
right now the ranks of objectivism are swelling with intelligent people who differ in background and in opinion .
mr. walker 's principle mistake is looking at objectivism as something that was born exclusively from the mind of ayn rand...something miss rand herself would disagree with .
objectivism is the logical continuation of a line of thought that views mankind as a reasoning animal...a line that extends back through history and begins ( explicitly ) with aristotle .
those ( like mr. walker ) who dismiss it on the basis of miss rand 's personality and the culture of people that grew around her in her lifetime are truly missing an opportunity to enlighten themselves .
there is no doubt ayn rand is a polarizing figure ; my advice to those inclined to read mr. walker 's book is to read miss rand 's books as well .
particularly her non-fiction .
i 'm not a real big fan of her novels or fiction in general - it was rand 's non-fiction works that first inspired me to study her philosophy - so my first suggestion would be " philosophy : who needs it .
" i enjoyed her novels , but i enjoyed her non-fiction more

i would normally not read barbara taylor bradford but my boyfriends ' mom gave it to me as part of a present , so i said what the heck , i 'll try it .
just as disappointing as i 'd expected .
light , uninteresting , and with no real plot or ending .
as for the historical pages , read catherine cookson instead .
i may go back and listen to a woman of substance only because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it .
but this sequel was too into clothes and the finer things , and full of too-successful , too-beautiful men and women .
not believable .

this was n't such a bad novel , and i kind of enjoyed it .
not great , but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly .
however , the ending really killed it for me .
it 's too unnecessarily long .
once the major conflict is resolved , the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah .
i wish i 'd just put the book down after the rain because i would 've left with a feeling of at least entertainment .
but after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications , only pages of explanations , i just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book .
would 've been three stars if it 'd just known when to end

hi ,
i have used this book among others to get accepted to mckinsey ( and with success ) and i think this book gave me less then others .
the advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter , but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous ( like for example the case in which a star-trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented , and the book claims that it would n't replace cars because it costs 100,000 $ .
come on , they would buy one for every block ) .
i think there are much better resources than this .
good luck with your interviews

timothy garton ash 's book the file was very provocative and interesting .
i thoroughly enjoyed reading the personal experience of one man who happened to be in east berlin before unification and then was able to see his file afterwards .
however , i am a bit disillusioned .
the story interests me but garton ash really does n't say anything !
i am disappointed that he so poignantly and blatantly pokes at communism and a totalitarian state .
and yet he does not back it up .
the book is good under the premise of democracy good , communism bad .
it feels like he is just pooling for support .
and nobody knew the wall was going to &quot ; fall&quot ; when it did .
i know of many professors who were writing books critiquing communism who had to throw out their text because of the abrupt fall of communism .
i 'm wondering if this book is just a way to cash in an unexpected event .
i am dissappointed .
maybe i just do n't know enough of garton ash but if this is the case , i should not have to feel the need to know his history before reading the book .
the book had some good points and kept me entertained but on the whole did n't do anything for me .
peace

this is a very famous and a very influential book .
this was not the first time i checked the book out of the library but i now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than i did when i first became familiar with kramer 's book .
what i found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me .
this is not a book supported by research .
it is a book of stories .
the stories , one after the other , are about kramer 's patients ( kramer is a psychiatrist ) and how taking prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight .
consider these four examples .
1 .
sam : " sam not only recovered from his depression , he declared himself better than well .
he felt unencumbered , more vitally alive , less pessimistic .
now he could complete projects in one draft , whereas before he sketched and sketched again .
his memory was more reliable , his concentration keener .
his memory was more reliable , his concentration keener .
every aspect of his work went more smoothly .
he appeared more poised , more thoughtful , less distracted .
he was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes .
( page x .
)
2 .
sally : after four months on prozac , she looked brighter , calmer , self-assured , in control of herself .
the most important effect of the medication , sally felt was that it cleared her head...after ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...more remarkable was the change to her private life .
she started going to dances... ( page 147 .
)
3 .
william m : the patient 's low self-esteem , which had been present since his earliest childhood , began to disappear...on medication william m. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before .
( page 203 .
)
4 .
ms. b : for the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...off prozac , ms. b. bar-hopped in search of men .
prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings .
dozens of other examples could be cited .
the point is , this is essentially the book .
it is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of prozac by sharing stories like these .
what is disturbing is that i now know the truth .
research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically .
they are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness , anxiety , depression , and a bad temper has increased dramatically .
we have come to believe , as kramer puts it , " biology is destiny " ( page xiv ) .
no where does kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of prozac to market was only 8 weeks long .
no where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is .
the dangers of long-term use ( diabetes , parkinson 's disease , permanent muscle jerking , etc .
) are never discussed .
( of course , these problems were still unknown when kramer wrote .
) see timothy scott 's wonderful , and unlike kramer 's book , carefully documented book america fooled : the truth about antidepressants , antipsychotics , and how we 've been fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health .
yes , this book has been influential .
thus , kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants .
( they do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies .
) it 's funny how , as our knowledge grows , a great book beomes a harmful book , but it is just that .

i work in a school library and as a cat lover am always seeking out the cat books .
this one caught my eye and i was expecting something wonderful .
i found the story to be hopeless and defeating .
how sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat .
i 'm no censor , but two thumbs way down .
also , if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss , try cynthia rylant 's , cat heaven

i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series .
years later i read s is for silence and was hooked .
i started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning .
i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine ( and forgiven ms. grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6 " frame ) .
however , i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best .
you just ca n't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly ( and unbelievable ) dangerous situation , to name a few .
the dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics .
but even with these issues , i did finish the book .
grafton at her low point is still a good read

it certainly sounded exciting .
unfortunately , it 's mostly a bunch of long winded articles on vague ideas that you 've already thought of a hundred times .
that 's not to say that the ideas are n't important .
i was simply expecting something a bit more focused by an author willing to take some risks .
on the bright side , the book wo n't become dated for quite some time .

</review_text>
<review_text>

the author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing , the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery .
i find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as bag of bones and the stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner .
fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict .
a body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body .
we learn the man was from colorado but very little else .
if the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened .
i would recommend a mary higgins clark mystery in place of this boo

flynn offers up a fast-paced , if unbelievable story .
unfortunately , character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences .
characters , like rapp , with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles , have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the " real world " works .
meanwhile , flynn 's politicians ( the majority of whom are democrats ) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election .
while there are grains of truth in his characters , flynn consistently goes for the cheap , partisan stereotype .
i was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller .
i 'm still looking .

i 'm really a great fan of douglas coupland , which is perhaps much of the reason i found this book so disappointing .
i hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new microserfs , since it totally lacks the insight , wit and 'funny because its true ' apsects of the original .
about the only thing it has in common with microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry .
jpod is set in a landscape of unreality , with no apparent reason than to make a series of whacky adventures for eccentric , and for the most part unlikeable , characters .
it certainly doesnt reflect the it industry of today , and the members of the jpod really only seem to represent those aspects of this community which give programmers a bad reputation , as essentially dysfunctional ( autistic ) as they are .
there doesnt even seem to be any real focus for this story .
i felt like i was mostly reading about a heap of stuff that 'happened' .
its not all bad , and there were more than a few humorous moments , and interesting plot twists .
coupland 's highly approachable and fast moving writing style has n't changed .
its really just the subject matter and whatever its trying to communicate that seems to have fallen in a heap , in this book .
i normally devour all of his books within a day or two , and want to read them again soon after , but it was a real struggle just to get through this one to the end

then you 'll probably like this story .
my wife and i read books together and i 'd sworn off cornwell after hornet 's nest ( which on tv cornwell admitted was some warmed over college material - and it showed horribly ) .
the scarpetta character ( in some books ) is unbelievably emotionally ultra-hyper ( going from confident to terrified every time marino knocks on the door ) .
in this book she was mercifully level headed almost all the time !
what a relief .
and there was a real story .
i 'm not really a fan of her work over the last 10 years but there 's almost enough lab details here to satisfy .
sure wish she ( scarpetta ) would learn to delegate - imagine the top lab expert for her state and she has to go to every crime scene and move bodies herself !
anyway do n't start here with the scarpetta series - but if you already like the character , this one is a b + .
compared to other crime novels in general , it 's still a c- in my estimation

this book is atrocious .
it is the worst book i have read in the last decade .
a 10 year old could have done better .
the plot gets more ridiculous as the book progresses , the characters act unbelievably and it is amazing that someone can actually get paid to write such garbage .
the only plus was that i got it out of the library and did n't pay for it

why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book ?
honestly , what has this author contributed to the world with this book ?
was it the characters ?
no , they 've all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years ( i.e .
cocky and handsome fbi agent , beautiful but dangerous killer with a past , take-no-sh # t fbi boss , etc. ) .
was it the deep insight into the characters themselves ?
a laugh out loud , " no ! " .
there was nothing coming close to character development .
was there some new and clever writing style ?
unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary ( i call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel ) .
how about the plot ?
was that something worth my time ?
not unless you have n't ever watched suspence movie in your life .
so honestly , what the hell makes this book worth anyone 's time ?
all i can find in this book are two dimensional characters , needless sub-plots , ludicris dialogue , and empty promises ( we 're lied to about the main character 's fate in the beginning and we 're lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of hitchcock ) .
as a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape hollywood 's onslaught of needless , pointless , and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage i can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money .
this man does not deserve our money and certainly does not deserve to write anything other than an apology letter to the world for dumbing us down into thinking that this type of writing is anything other than trash

my friend 's and i will pass books back and forth to each other to read if they are good .
my friend was going to throw this one out instead of passing it along , but since i have a dog , i thought it would be interesting , but it was n't , so i had the honor of throwing it out myself .
typically , i would donate the book or give it to charity , but i do n't think anyone would enjoy it .
it 's just this author 's drivel .
it does n't focus on the president 's and their pets at all like the title suggests .
i could see where another author could have created a really fun book about presidents and their dogs .

this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin .
first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks .
there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc .
this is our second chance on earth .
no tribulation .
this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly .
reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian .
why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life .
it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message .
plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it .
but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) .
my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) .
man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck .

ms. reichs has lost the recipe , or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to cross bones .
although not nearly as bad as p. cornwell 's last two or three misfires , reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here .
in this offering , temperance is out of character , out of both style and focus , and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous ; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product .
even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice reichs has maintained in her many brennan novels .
having finally given up on cornwell , after many years , i 'll hang in there for one more temperance brennan dig ; everyone is entitled to one gong

& # 65279 ; millennials rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors william strauss and neil howe , focusing this time on the generation born after x .
for those not already familiar with the authors ' theory , strauss and howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991 .
they wrote the book generations , which introduced a theory that generations fall into four re-cycling types , and each type comes of age during a different kind of era , or " turning " .
the silent generation is of the " adaptive " type , for instance , passive , gentle , and in tune with their emotions , and came of age during the golden age of postwar america .
the baby boomers , remembered for their " awakening " in the 1960s , are of the " idealist " type , concerned with god and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in , but inclined to change during life ( from hippie to the current " just say no " control freak ) .
generation x , which they named the thirteenth generation , is of the " reactive " type , being alienated , street-smart and materialistic , without a feeling of need to be " loyal " to anything , coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s .
they then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the " millennial generation " , and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be optimistic , hard-working and clean-cut , just like the g.i .
generation that fought world war ii , going back to the " civic " type generation before the silent generation .
in 1993 they published the book thirteenth gen , which specialized in generation x and why they are the way they are .
in their third book , the fourth turning , they went back to the whole theory and writing about all the generations .
they also changed the archetype names from adaptive , idealist , reactive and civic to artist , prophet , nomad and hero .
strauss and howe wrote in this book about an upcoming era of epic battle and mass destruction , much like the one in which the g.i .
generation came of age .
they then predicted the millennial generation would form the role of heroes during the coming crisis , and they would lower teen pregnancy rates , stop using drugs , serve the united states , in uniform even , and desist with using profanity .
so then in 2000 they put out this book , millennials rising .
in this one the authors try to explain the millennial generation ( my generation ) .
millennials rising attempts to identify who we , the most ethnically diverse generation in american history as they note , are .
in millennials rising they write about this generation 's boomer parents and their influence on the millennial generation , as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up ( which s&h think of as hundreds of television channels , suv lifestyles , rappers who swear , and people who smack each other on tv ) .
the book states that millennials want to work together in teams , believe the people in authority know more about right and wrong than they do , are enthusiastic about learning and going to school , are loved and protected by their parents , achieve great things in school and will achieve great things in the future , and lest we forget , always want to exude that " positive peer pressure " on their fellow millennials .
the obviously leads to the question , then , is the generation really optimistic , hard-working and clean-cut just as they say ?
consider this : only 28 % of high school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is " meaningful " , only 21 % describe their courses as " interesting " and still barely over a third , 39 % , believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life .
the generation was supposed to be enthusiastic about learning .
the millennial generation also rapidly increased drug use , especially pot , from the level at which generation x was using them in its teens , as even the authors themselves note .
s&h portray the world of edgy entertainment , such as television shows , movies and music , as a zoroastrian battle .
in popular music , for instance , artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side , artists like eminem , limp bizkit and marilyn manson , on the other , boy bands and britney spears and her imitators , along with such second-tier bands as the s club 7 .
they do not deal with the millennial interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two .
for instance , blink-182 is just about the biggest band around now , and yet millennials rising does not mention blink-182 and the many young fans who make the band a success .
south park : bigger , longer , uncut is the authors ' idea of where popular culture is today .
millennials rising heralds boy bands as what music will increasingly be like as the current decade unfolds , and blasts the " edgy " bands as groups that will be washed away , but could the authors have predicted bands like good charlotte or artists like avril lavigne ?
this leads to the bigger question of whether the book and the theory will be able to predict anything .
s&h write about " rebelling by being better " during the present decade .
apparently , their idea of rebellion is not listening to limp bizkit , blasting censorship , or doing illegal drugs , but wearing preppy clothes , waiting until marriage to have sex , and trusting their government .
according to them , we should expect to see millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their own peers .
s&h write that we will accept the draft and join the military in great numbers when the crisis presents us with a war , and even do national service .
frankly , can anyone imagine any more than 20 % of today 's high school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of america ?
also , our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following bush as leader during the iraq war , while s&h predict millennials serving their president .
how suited to a hero generation is that ?
the g.i .
generation followed fdr so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in braille .
when it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis , millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would .
this , of course , does not have to be a bad thing , but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the predictive abilities of the theory .
some parts of it make for very interesting reading , but all the talk about how they are to be the " next great " generation gets to you sometimes .
s&h seem to believe you can never think too big about those millennials .
millennials rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers , but sometimes what the book describes just is n't happening

it certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge-based workers are the future in american society .
it seems to me that drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize marx , which was a complete failure .
drucker did n't even fully analyze globalization in its entirety .
the only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the american worker .
nonetheless , he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society .
look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in .
drucker neglects the whole and simply accepts what backs his own perspective

this fourth installment of becky 's trying tribulations is the worst .
the qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment .
i do n't understand how kinsella 's editor did n't draw the line ( and the red pencil ) at the litany of shopping expeditions .
and her endless , excrutitating 'inner ' reflections .
becky 's exploits are n't amusing anymore .
her purchases on her honeymoon are n't wacky .
they 're bewildering .
for a shopaholic with supposedly good taste , becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on ebay once home in england .
and oh yes , then she discovers a long lost sister .
that situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book .
and then bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by tarquin in his personal helicopter .
i am not making this up .
it 's all there in the book .
and none of it is even remotely entertaining .
and now god help us , becky is pregnant .
aarrgggh !

this is a revolutionary book .
it introduces the stage metaphor into sociology ; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage .
it 's questionable how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its first explicit statement .
the language used to present the ideas of the author is , like most sociological writing , unecessarily complicated .
there are some problems with clarity and structure ; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me .
no sociological background is presupposed , there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources , many footnotes , and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book .
so if you are interested in reading sociology , this is probably a good place to start ( again , the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction ) .
however , the book is misguided .
the idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary .
the authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer .
( the following is a charicature of the author 's argument ) .
there is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people ( the audience ) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor .
well , if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations , infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage , " all the world is not , of course , a stage , but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify " ( p 72 ) .
the performances can either be with individuals , or groups of people , and they can be performing conciously or unconciously .
( end of charicature )

there are other arguments , obviously , and the statement " we can draw a parallel with other situations " is most of the content of the book , which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence .
but the real question here is , is the view worthwhile ?
my answer : no .
social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor .
yes , some social interaction is like a performance , where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another .
yes , some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs .
however , most social interaction is exactly the way we see it , conciously controlled , meaningful , purposeful interaction with individuals ; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a " reality " .
i hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out : the book is a waste of time .
where the author is right , the statement is little more than common sense .
where the author goes outside of common sense , he 's wrong , sometimes plainly so .
this book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes , that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control ( here the wool is the performance , and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions ) .
there is no real empirical support given for most of the claims .
where " evidence " is given , the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter .
where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth .
various sources of sociology are cited , but this is more like intellectual bullying .
saying that some author , which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims , agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims .
the claims in the book have no practical application in the world , but only serve to intepret situations differently , and in personal opinion , less correctly .
nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology .
in short , this isnt a scientific study at all .
my final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph , the use of language .
the best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction " a performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants " ( 15 ) .
this is a curios definition .
me breathing while i work is a performance , it changes the percentages of o2 and co2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers .
me staring into space is a performance , other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced .
infact , me simply existing is a performance , since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants , as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing .
its as if goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person , and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance .
he didnt .
he used a word that we associate with controlled behavior ( performance ) and defined it in a way no one is used to .
then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance , its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality .
i hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to goffman and sociology more generally .
so an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt .
why wont this subject go away ?
this book is an integral part of sociology , and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition .
the methods are questionable ; the style is obscure .
like it or hate it , sociology is a part of modern thought .
read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings

robin williams used to tell a joke about his son , saying that whenever he got angry with him his son would say 'you hit me and i 'll write a book .
' i 'd like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind peggy salinger 's memior about life with her father , but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea .
although there are some interesting revelations about salinger as a man , his daughter does n't seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of jd salinger , they 're the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday .
there 's a lot of blame thrown around here , and not a whole lot of admitting to one 's own mistakes .
although this is probably to be expected , it 's still frustrating , since margaret salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her father 's good name , and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical .
( complaining about your father 's desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea .
) i admit that her father is probably not as nice a guy as you think he would be , but this is not really a revelation , nor should it affect your feelings about his work .
i would n't recommend reading it unless your working on a thesis of some sort

i was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian .
well , i was wrong .
it was long , tedious and nasty .
granted , chaplin was not perfect , but the author 's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening .
a better title for this book would be 'trash , what i think of charlie' .
joyce milton would do well writing for tabloids. .

many reviewers on this site read tlgpe in the 70 's , when we were young and impressionable .
( i happened to be 13 when i read it .
) if one could be sued for intellectual forgery , lindsey would certainly be found at fault .
most of us , thankfully , have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years .
after all , when we read tlgpe , we were young .
we were searching and seeking .
we did n't have all of the facts .
there were wolves who knew this , and they preyed upon us .
many people who were older , yet still intellectually undeveloped , read this book and were moved to 'believing' .
for most of us , our minds matured .
we began to see the vast chinks in lindsey 's pompous christian armor .
we began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen , by people who use a subtle , gentle cloth of manipulation to control others .
this is beyond dangerous .
it is beyond extreme , as most of us have now found out .
i love a good horror novel .
i love a good 'true crime ' thriller .
but the fact that people read lindsey 's books and take them at face value is , perhaps , one of the scariest notions i have ever imagined .
that , dear reader , is beyond horrific .
.
.
and far more terrifying than anything you 'll find in the bible or any of lindeys 'books' .
the only thing scarier is that mr. lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated , silly , contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago .
please do n't be the next sucker .
please do n't add this one to your cart .

this should be retitled " the leftist , israel-hating , politically correct revisionist guide to the middle east .
" that would be far more accurate .
for a textbook , the author freelances just a tad bit too much , a lot of what is in here is presented as fact but is mostly opinion in disguise .
the author fails in presenting a clear and unbiased view of the middle east and instead allows his personal politics to get in the way .
my professor dumped this book as the course textbook 1/4 of the way through the semester due to the never-ending left-leaning political commentary .
this is no serious review of the middle east , just a socialist-based fantasy on how things should be .
the author himself proclaims that accuracy is n't always important , its the idea that matters .
this book is a joke , i looked for something serious , unbiased to aid me in learning more about the middle east but this book does n't present anything new and its political leanings are just to the left of stalin .
if you want to learn what an extreme left liberal thinks of the middle east , buy this book , otherwise stick to encyclopedias and hopefully , less biased college textbooks .

if you 're going to write about the city that is paris , you 'd better be up to the task .
gopnik may have the writing and observation skills that would have served this assignment well , but this collection of essays generally falls flat .
for someone who resided in the city of light for 5 whole years , gopnik gives us a surprisingly myopic picture constrained by his own self-absorption .
those who are interested in paris and its natives will be sorely disappointed in the smug chronicles of a new yorker who regards himself and his son to be the most interesting elements of this city .
i have zero interest in my-toddler-does-paris stories and gopnik 's relentless insertion of his look-how-cute-my-kid-is accounts should have been saved for a family re-union instead of wasting precious space that could have been used for more interesting topics .
for a better book on paris cuisine and culture , check out the collection of gourmet essays from the last 60 years titled 'remembrance of things paris' .
it provides a wider variety of perspectives and a more expansive and interesting view of paris -- and it 's blessedly free of all that baby 's-scrapbook stuff .

the book is n't good at all .
i 'm sorry .
i loved i am legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies ( hell house included ) i was really excited to read this .
i have heard many complaints about the book from calling it " soft porn " to " sick soft porn " and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale .
sacrilege in a book called...hell house is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up .
attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary .
i doubt these were mathis ' " sexual fantasies " in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying .
it is an effective way to convey horror to a reader .
similar to enacting horrible violence on children , or worse , babies in cinema ( try watching the hills have eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face ) .
mathis should not be condemned for content .
here is what he did right .
he took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science .
much like i am legend used science to define its vampires , hell house uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and believable within the framework of the story .
the bad parts may be more numerous .
his characterization is horrid .
there are four characters really and their personalities do not define them .
you will remember barrett by his limp , fishcer by his fear , florence by her religious beliefs , and edith...well because there is no one else .
they are paper thin and have no real motivations .
the pacing seems poor too .
a lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you , the reader .
as a matter of fact the revelations themselves , when all is said and done , are really pretty dull .
there is also a habit characters have , when going into great lengths of exposition that goes on for pages , to cup their hands around a coffee cup .
it seems too much like a commercial for me !
anyway , the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very few vivid descriptions in the book .
sometimes i wanted to know what things looked like , i wanted imagery not just exposition for pages .
what was it about the atmosphere that , say fischer found so scary ?
we needed the scenes to be better developed .
by the end i was so tired of lines like :

" god do you know what this means ?
"
" what ?
"
" i ca n't tell you now but it 's freakin ' awesome !
"

that exchange is not in the book but you will find many similar moments throughout .
just tell us already !
the fear should come through our attachment to the characters not the mystery of the house because the mystery of the house is kind of weak .
this book is not worth it , unfortunately .
i hate to say it because i am legend is really good ( though it did suffer from some of the same things i pointed out above , though on a smaller level ) .
it 's the classic " show do n't tell " advice

no thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story .
the whole thing is based on who wants to kill darby and why .
and that is where it falls apart .
the fbi or cia could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could , and what is the point of trying to kill her ?
to bury what is already out in the open ?
the fbi , cia and white house all had a copy .
what are they trying to silence ?
nothing at all .
perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself

this book is more of the same rehashed , recycled , repurposed content from the authors .
much of this material is available in any basic marketing text .
in fact , this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding .
if you 've worked at any of the big agencies : mccann , jwt , y&r , you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour .
all the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak .
the " editorial reviews " listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as " cases " in the book .
remember this before you buy : the author , and the firm for whom he works , use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it 's called " thought leadership " , a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking .
save your money .
do n't become a victim of prophet 's propoganda .

" a dirty job " was my first christopher moore novel , and will probably be my last .
i was captivated by the story line as i read the dust jacket , but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting .
i thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest , and very little addressing the actual theme of the book .
although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book 's hero , i just was n't drawn in enough to care about him .
the action began in the final quarter of the book , and you had better suspend reality before reading it .
i actually could n't wait for the book to end so i could move on to something more interesting

the word atlas is misleading as there is alot of text accompanying the various maps .
some pages are nothing but text .
i expect an atlas to use maps to explain more rather than words .
the maps that are in the book are good , but numerous sections do not have one .
the book is split into sections/topics written by individual persons .
however , in many sections the text ends in mid-sentence , as if several pages were forgotten about in each section or as if there was some arbitrary cutoff on the # of words per section .
of this approx 200 page book , sentence cutoffs appear on these pages .
each page also represents the end of a section .
p.37,55,63,82,89,96,115,141,149,163 , and 175

clearly , not just a simple oversight .
also , the table of contents is inadequate , as it primarily denotes the major sections - which is by ocean , but not the individual topics .
i give this 2 stars ( rather than 1 ) as the idea is good , and the content that is in the book - looks good .
execution is another story .
frankly , i would be a embarassed by the editing and quality control oversights

the republican right wing nut job wackos invented the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage , and its simply not true .
republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country , all they know how to do is lie , cheat , steal , and profit off of the suffering of others .
oh yeah , and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe .

sadly , this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today .
between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects , it can take ages to puzzle out a page .

my husband has read all the patrick o'brian series , so i asked him to puzzle out a representative story , that of counahan the navigator , and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood , he said , " honey , i see what you mean .
" one can get the general gist , but it 's best to read through fast , then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense .
for example , when educated harvey says , " why ca n't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories ?
" his pal dan answers , " allus can , till we begin to dress daown .
efter thet , the heads and offals , 'u 'd scare the fish to fundy .
boat-fishin ' ai n't reckoned progressive , though , unless ye know as much as dad knows .
guess we 'll run aout aour trawl to-night .
harder on the back , this , than frum the dory , ai n't it ?

i got my b.a .
in english , and i would rather tackle joyce 's " ulysses " than an unannotated version of this book .
so why did i bother ?
a few days ago , a friend showed us the dvd of the 1937 movie , starring spencer tracy and lionel barrymore , on his big screen home theater , and it was thrilling and very moving .
the movie is quite different from the book , though , but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how kipling crafted the story , as it did for me .
but dear teachers , please , do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever !
( let them read " cannery row " instead !
)

i would not personally recommend this book to horror/thriller fans .
i would definitely not recommend this book for anyone under 18 !
if you like soap operas , you may enjoy this book a lot .
if you are searching for the secrets of rose red or a good ghost story , this is not your book .
i read the story before the author was made known .
i thought it might be stephen king or tabitha king .
the writing style was far below stephen king 's style and it was very erotic , which i suspected tabitha king to be the author .
however , the accounts of ellen were obviously written by a man , as the erotic episodes were definitely not from the viewpoint of a woman .
so , it was no surprise when the author was neither stephen nor tabitha , but a male author i have never heard of .
the book reveals almost nothing new about rose red and it 's secrets .
i would dare say that 90 % of the diary goes on and on about ellen and john 's wealth and extremely dysfunctional marriage .
on and on about john 's extramarital affairs , ellen 's withholding of sexual favors , more affairs , more withholding of favors , more affairs , more favors withheld .
the story is a vicious circle regarding this .
it 's almost like she gets burned , but yet continues to play with fire .
very frustrating and almost boring , as you read the same scenarios redundantly .
by the third time , you know exactly what he 's doing and how she will retaliate .
silly .
i mentioned above that the diary of ellem rimbauer revealed no new secrets of the house .
in fact , as the diary progresses , it skips four occurrences ( it made mention of the four , like " by the way , four disappearances happened since last time i wrote , but i wo n't tell you about them " ) .
and this i found obnoxious - * * * spoiler alert * * * ellen waits some three or so years for a sance from a master uber-psychic .
three long years .
but after the sance , nothing is revealed !
the book is riddled with episodes like this .
some big secret is coming .
when it finally is revealed , it 's no secret at all .
it 's something dumb , like " yes , there are spirits in the house " .
what spirits ?
why ?
who ?
nothing is ever satisfactorily explained .
i would have given it one star , however it seemed to have a single quality .
at the start of the diary , ellen was an ordinary 19 year old fiance to john .
soon , she is corrupted by john , wealth , maybe corrupted by her african best friend ( jury is still out ) , and hatred .
she prays to god , but also to " her other god " ( the dark one ) .
at first , you suppose she is playing with fire .
right on .
she gets consumed by darkness , revenge , and hatred and falls into self destruction .
overall , i personally thought it read like fan fiction .
i would bet the author whipped up this short story just for giggles , but somehow it got published .
i was disappointed , hoping for a good ghost story .
but i ended up reading a soft-porn , soap opera style plot .
hope i do n't offend those who loved the book :

the book 's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues .
this approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a lesbian led household - especially a girl child .
if the child is a boy and/or approachng 8 or 9 years old , the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked .
does n't everyone have a father , somewhere ?
who is my father ?
what is he like ?
where is he ?
does he know about me ?
does he care about me ?
why do n't i know ?
why do n't you know , mommy ?
mommy , when you grew up you lived with your daddy , why do n't i ?
when i grow up , should i live with a man or a woman ?
why ?
how/when will i know ?
does it matter ?
is our family really a complete family if my father is unknown ?
i want to be a father some day .
how do i learn what good fathers do ?
i love my friends and my dog ; does that make us a family ?

there is no proof in this stinking pile of filth .
he 's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book-i 'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense , but i do n't think it should matter .
i am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts , and tipler just does n't make any sense .
his writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time .

the very first thing you read in this book is a mistake .
the prologue begins with a photo of german pows at the end of wwi .
the photo caption states that the german army at the end of wwi was " unbroken " and implies that germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership .
this is doubly misleading .
the german army was soundly defeated on western front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate .
in 1918 , germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by ludendorff and hindenberg .
the political leaders who lost will were the german high command .
defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army .
keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious " stab in the back " myth used by the german military and right wing propagandists to undermine the weimar republic .
its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters .
this type of error recurs throughout this book .
my favorite relatively minor error is keegan moving the ploesti oilfields , a major strategic resource , from romania to hungary .
see prior reader reviews for documentation of a number of factual errors of varying magnitude .
just as important and in some cases even more important are keegan 's failures to discuss crucial aspects of wwii .
he makes little effort , for example , to discuss the origins of the war .
indeed , his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss .
leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this crucial topic , there are excellent overviews of 20s and 30s that are good guides to this admittedly formidable topic .
instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war , we get a superficial and somewhat misleading discussion of how industrialization transformed military technology and organization .
instead of a discussion of the sad history of the weimar republic , crucial for understanding the ascent of the nazis , we get another misleading discussion of the freikorps phenomenon .
among other significant omissions are his failure to grapple with the possible strategic significance of the allied bombing campaign against germany , a issue analyzed insightfully by richard overy in 2 of his excellent books .
keegan 's discussion of the holocaust in both inadequate and implicitly misleading .
partly because he does n't discuss the origins of the war and the role played by nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in crucial respects the holocaust was the point of german aggression .
the nazis went to war not just to overturn the versailles settlement or even to conquer eastern europe , but to impose their bizarre notions of racial conflict on the rest of europe .
without this background , its impossible to understand the outbreak and the specific nature of wwii .
among other things , nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the western soviet union , a factor in their eventual defeat .
as pointed out by other reviewers , keegan devotes a disproportionate amount of the book to activities of the western allies when the eastern front was really the crucial theatre .
to be fair to keegan , writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very difficult .
the best 1 volume work on wwii is gerhard weinberg 's book , which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly small font .
some of the individual sections of this book are quite good and keegan has a nice , sometimes actually elegant , writing style .
none of these positive features , however , can overcome his neglect of basic features of wwii and the lack of attention to basic facts .
this is not just error , this is actual negligence .

this book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms .
as a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure , i am always willing to learn more about any kind of bodywork .
i had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it .
the book gives some accupoints for specific problems , some of these are " golden points " able to stand alone in use , but others are not .
the book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence , or not .
also,it does't tell where the points are exactly .
there are really too many flaws to go into here .
acupressure is very complex , this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo

the number of books written in our society is huge and getting huger .
everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read .
why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market ?
one reason , apparently embraced by the goldstones , is that it is so easy to write a book !
all you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences .
they do n't have to be particularly interesting experiences .
you do n't have to do any research into your subject .
if you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing , if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took , if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers ( even if they are not interesting or witty ) , and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in , you can finish the book in a couple of weekends !
and readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done .
the book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors , and i recognized some of my own experiences in the stories the authors tell .
however , the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over common early errors , nor does it attempt to answer many of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting .
what determines the price of old books ?
why are first editions important ?
why should tarzan books cost more than great works of literature ?
these are good questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting , and you will find the questions but not the answers here .
the book is written in a breezy style that is easy to get through , and if you have two hours at an airport to kill , you could do worse than to read it .
but by the time you arrive at your destination , you will have likely forgotten most of what you just read , because so much of it is ephemeral details of the authors ' own lives , transportation problems , and experiences .
if you are really interested in book collecting , it would be wise to read one of the many books that describe what one should look for , how prices are determined , different styles of book collecting , and so on .
fragments of this knowledge are transmitted in this book , but they will leave you with more questions than answers .
to be sure , not every book about book collecting needs to be a font of wisdom .
but the entertainment value of the authors ' experiences was weak , and did not make up for the absence of useful content

this book is filled with " glam " pictures of recycled design ideas by billy haines,dorothy draper and billy baldwin,mostly of the " hollywood regency " style .
ms wearstler,whose home it is , appears in the photos dressed to the nines and seems to want us to think that she dreamed up this nifty new look .
take a look at the new billy haines book and the just released book on dorothy draper and you 'll see real designers at work and whose work and style this really is .

fans of the abc-tv show " lost " will probably be buying " our mutual friend " in droves after having seen desmond keeping it to be the " last book [ i ] ever [ read ] " .
since i did not have to buy it , having purchased a full set of dickens years ago , i immediately set out to read it .
what a disappointment it was !
dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period .
one can not avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is , just a bit , perhaps , 'padded' .
any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages .
dickens ' work is melodrama , but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art .
as oscar wilde said of 'the old curiosity shop ' , " i simply can not read of the death of little nell without laughing .
" 'omf ' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence .
even worse is the ending .
some endings just ca n't help but feel contrived ; and dickens , having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions , pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated .
all of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for " the complete oxford illustrated dickens " but i assure you that my only concern is for you , gentle reader .
unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of dickens ' oeuvre or are required to read " our mutual friend " , i would , instead , direct you to dickens ' far superior works : 'david copperfield ' , 'oliver twist ' , 'pickwick papers' .
if you are looking for 'lost ' reading material , i would refer you to 'watership down ' ( excellent ) , 'the stand ' ( by stephen king , entertainment , not literature ) , 'the dark tower ' series ( by stephen king , entertainment , not literature , and similar to 'our mutual friend ' possessed of a fatally flawed ending ) or a review of philosophy like 'locke , rousseau and hume' .

the title is a misrepresentation .
this is not a handbook for driving a porsche quickly or professionally .
i bought this book because in 2 months i am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a f1 circuit .
i have no circuit experience , and can not get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country i live in .
since this is a rear engined car which i have little experience with i was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars .
there is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving porsches or rear engined cars .
the only reason i will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960 's and early 19970 's porsche racing pictures ( poor quality black and white though ) .
also to be fair there are some good racing stories .
he is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing .
a better title would be " my porsche racing history " .
if you want a book on fast driving i would highly recommend ross bentley 's " speed secrets " in place of this book

when i picked up this book i had high expectations,seeing that it had received good reviews.it opened quite spectacularly as well , on a rather surreal note.but as i read on , i could n't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent , rambling tale.the book seemed like a sloppy , haphazard collection of incidents that did n't make much sense or assist character development .
the central character herself was unbelievable and i found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.it seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky .
some incidents were quite mirth-provoking , however,that 's why i gave it two stars

the plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many .
why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attachcase , when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is ?
we know where the precious document is : another useless quest .
people are murdered by the half dozen , the characters are outrageous , most of the time improbable , and i felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid , not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it .
i have read much better books than that .

this book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science : write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content , and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible .
what a bunch of baloney .
first of all , evolution , in the sense of " common descent , " is not impossible .
even id-iot superstars michael behe , stephen meyer , and jonathan wells have admitted as much .
( see a summary of their recent testimony in the kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution/creationism forum at the west virginia gazette .
( wvgazettemail ) ( put " /forums " after com ) so any id-iot who thinks all that bafflegab about irreducible complexity ( ic ) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply ignorant .
man evolved from non-human ancestors .
get over it .
thaxton in particular ought to read that summary , since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly id-iotic .
in any case , the empirical data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab .
talking about the allegedly empirical foundation for intelligent design makes it sound deliciously scientific , especially to poorly educated id-iots , who generally are clueless about real science ; but even if the empirical data is accurate , it 's nothing but a facade , because it has nothing to do with the book 's main conclusion .
for example , imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play beethoven concertos on the piano .
skeptical , you ask for proof .
" simple , " your neighbor replies .
" see , here 's my dog , and there 's my piano .
" only a moron would accept that as " proof , " and yet id-iot christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of " proof " from id-iotic films like this .
the problem with your neighbor 's " proof " is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano .
neither of those issues , however , was the real cause of your skepticism , so the " proof " was entirely meaningless .
the critical issue , of course , was not the mere existence of the dog and the piano , but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano , and your neighbor 's " proof " was completely silent on that issue .
again , only a moron would accept evidence of mere existence as proof of piano-playing ability .
in this book , there 's a lot of talk about how complex certain biological systems are .
that is nothing but meaningless bafflegab , because the mere existence of complex systems is not a disputed issue .
the disputed issue is how those systems came into being , and on that issue the book 's " evidence " is completely silent .
this book was designed to fool poorly educated , easily impressed id-iots .
judging from the five-star reviews , it seems to have succeeded .
well , there 's a sucker born every minute , and apparently a lot of them are found in evangelical churches and seminaries .
in one of the very first evolution debates , thomas huxley accused bishop wilberforce of using his intellectual and oratorical gifts to mislead and bamboozle people .
things have n't changed much since then .
instead of meaningful evidence , this book substitutes a god-of-the-gaps argument .
" gee , look how complex it is .
it must have been created by an intelligent designer .
maybe , just maybe , it was god .
wink , wink .
"

god-of-the-gaps arguments are dumb .
only ignorant suckers are taken in by them .
so if any of those folks who wrote five-star reviews for this book would like to buy a nice bridge in brooklyn or a dog who can play beethoven concertos on the piano , please give me a call .
i 'll be happy to provide evidence !

a writer for the irish echo said this book should have been titled " the protocols of the elders of erin .
" it was written around the time al smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist , anti-catholic prejudices of upstate new york and america at that time .
while there really were gangs in that era , most of new york 's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like st. vincent 's , fordham , st. john 's , manhattan and manhattanville .
the vast majority of the city 's population including its immigrants did n't riot in 1863 .
in fact new york city 's 200,000 soldiers and sailors , more than half of whom were immigrants , won over 100 + medals of honor during america 's civil war .
it 's a tribute to the persistence of prejudice that this book is n't more widely recognized as the nasty practical joke that it is

in the post 9/11 world in which this book , subtitled " the clash between islam and modernity in the middle east " was published , it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day .
this , however , is not to be found in what went wrong ?
instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae .
we learn , for instance , that , " a distinguishing characteristic of western music is polyphony , by harmony or counterpoint .
this begins in its simplest form with the choir , in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect ; then comes the keyboard instrument , matching the ten fingers of the two hands , following different routes in a common purpose ; and finally , the musical ensemble , from duets and trios to the full orchestra " .
while this is all well and good , and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level , it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of " the clash between islam and modernity... " that has led to the precarious times in which we live .
or , on another note ( harmony ?
counterpoint ?
) we learn that robinson crusoe was translated into arabic by butrus al-bustani and published in the late 1850 's .
big deal !
what we do n't learn anything about is the rise of militant islamism .
there is no mention of wahhabism or how this fundamentalist islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity .
the muslim brotherhood also is not to be found in the index , nor is there a mention of sayyid qutb , or his writing of the incendiary manifesto , milestones .
furthermore , there is not a single reference to al-qaeda , though usama bin laden does appear , albeit seemingly as an afterthought , in what appears to be a hastily added afterword .
so what went wrong ?
beats me. .

this is a very bad book .
it is poorly written , the characters are caricatures in misery , and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter , who suffers in silence after the devastating , and , to her , mysterious , death of her mother .
her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter .
he is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child 's behavior , which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response , rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion .
he fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break .
i could n't finish this .

sadly , i gave up on it about 100 pages in .
i felt there was so much mundane writing and hardly any dialog between not only the two main characters but between any characters at all .
it just feels completely unemotional and without any sort of feeling-there is nothing exciting about this book .
the heroine is naive , and not in a good way .
i hope the others in this series are better .

this book provides a good overview of blacks ( slave and free ) in new york .
it 's a very good reference ( encyclopedic ) book .
my main problem with it is that leslie m. harris , the author , relies heavily ( if not entirely ) on secondary sources .
the book , then , is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works .
hence , finding the actual primary source ( i.e .
court decision , council minutes , etc ) proves extremely difficult .
i do not recommend this book for advanced students .
if , however , you 're interested in an easy read and do n't care about sources , this is the book for you

&quot ; i have received your new book against the human race , and thank you for it .
never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid .
one longs , in reading your book , to walk on all fours .
but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years , i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it .
nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada , because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me ; because war is going on in those regions ; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves.&quot ; voltaire ( 1755

in a world desperate for health solutions , the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity .
alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters .
careful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant oriental women , it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born .
hence the seven ( 7 ) percent utilization of this water in that part of the world .
elsewhere , mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the japanese organizations which promote alkaline water .
common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake , then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral ph liquid is the answer .
alkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood ph with high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put you in the emergency room as my medic ( 1985 nobel prize recipient ) clearly points out .
you might as well drink battery acid he said , the result will be the same stress on your blood ph .
here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood ph .
he continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system , the very low ph which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly .
the various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers .
the alkaline promoters , including this book 's author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with even the very basics of body chemistry and metabolic processes .
read the book for entertainment and not for education and utility in your daily nutritional program

i found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics , with no insights .
since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors , and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface , i was n't expecting historical depth .
but i was expecting at least one fresh idea .
i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg ( about technology in the economy of the 19th century ) .
i was disappointed .
i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower -- college freshmen born in the 1980s .
i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy

this book is simply horrible .
repetitive dialogue and situations .
characters that just make you groan and roll your eyes .
i 've read two by this author and she 's just awful .
both books used the same lines over and over again .
the stories chased their tails in circles half the time .
dull , repetitive and annoying .

ok , i ca n't deny it , this book was well written .
but what made me throw up is the age differance , i mean what the hell !
how can tana like someone who 's 30 years older than her ?
that 's aweful !
this is what i really hate about dan 's books , she hooks someone who 's 20 with some1 who 's 35. i do n't find that interesting .
all i can say about full circle is that it 's good but so depressing .
it made me cry ( which proves that danielle is a good writer ) do n't read this book if you are not ready to get depressed

i have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and i love books , so this is drastic !
spoilers ahead - please do n't read on if you have n't read the book .
i managed to ( somehow ) get through the first book , 'wideacre ' , which i disliked - whilst i adore the rest of gregory 's novels , so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book , the sequel as i 'd bought it and it looked more promising .
it was 'marginally better ' as one reader put it , than the first , but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed .
i was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted , julia 's consistent inability to stand up to richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore .
i quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in !
because i wanted so much for julia to be with james - who i liked a great deal .
i was so depressed after everything went wrong and she did n't marry him... ah , because i was expecting the usually very clever ms gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say , aha !
she does get her true love in the end and she and ralph get rid of richard and although it 's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to wideacre .
the rape scene with julia and richard was very violent and far too detailed and i think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that , in fact , for anyone at all .
i do n't want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much , but i really did feel strongly that julia should have gone to ralph for help when she concieved the child with richard .
this was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right .
clean slate , so to speak .
yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks james to find the child ? !
what ? !
and i was expecting perhaps a deformed child , after all this inbreeding ( i mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister and grandparents who are brother and sister ! ! !
) but she was perfect and beautiful .
i was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she 'd never be found again.. but alas , the lacey madness will live on.. .
the perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist .
gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of beatrice and julia 's era had by richard being killed by ralph , then julia inheriting the land - baby sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or ( this would have been lovely - i bet all the girls have sighed over james a little , did n't you ?
he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in austen 's books ) james forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and julia 's was not intentional nor her fault ( i was practically screaming at her that it was n't her fault - and she gets it in the end , when it 's too late !
) and they marry and have 'normal ' children - or perhaps none , they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other , and make a fresh start for wideacre .
there were so many allies that julia had - she was a sweet girl and i liked her - i wish that i could have shaken her though , i got so mad .
so many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with richard could have been avoided - ahhh.. .
so frustrating .
i will not be reading the third book in the series .
i shall go back to reading gregory 's more historic novels ( a constant princess is one i have n't read yet and it sounds excellent ) .
i would n't recommend this one

chromosome 6 has a great premise : what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people ; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy ?
how much would people pay for this service ?
how far would they go to protect it ?
what are the moral implications ?
robin cook comes full circle , returning to the themes of his 1970s novel , coma .
coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed ; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors , and the dignity those relationship once preserved .
now , a quarter century later , robin cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare .
chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit .
in this novel , there is mystery and murder ; medical sleuthing and exotic , international sets .
there are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that i can not believe it has robin cook 's name on it .
though not high literature , robin cook 's novels have always been tight and suspenseful , with believable characters and settings that seemed real .
the characters in chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill , the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted .
turn a page and the story just ends...what ?
that 's it ?
are you kidding ?
did robin cook really write this ?
i do n't think so .

well , if anything this was a decently written story , with good dialect and character detail .
however , this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending .
grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there .
the story starts off with pi kinsey milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door .
she opens it to find janice kepler , mother of lorna kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter 's mysterious death .
not only this , but she also explains to kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because lorna 's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house .
they talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter 's death until janice tells kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after lorna 's death .
this tape leads kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer .
millhone dives even further and searches through the world of lorna 's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive , elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount .
kinsey also checks up on lorna 's family members , and with the exception of janice , all seem to have a motive to murder her lorna .
not being a fan of these types of novels , i decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere .
by the middle of the novel i wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story , but when i got to the end i had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended .
i stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like grafton did too .
the ending left me with a strange feeling and i did n't know if the book had actually ended .
all in all , it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you 're a murder mystery fan , try any other of grafton 's alphabet themed novels besides this one

after get shorty , e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again , with this single-minded purpose focused , e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty .
and he was right again , it was bought and made into a movie again , but pathetically , a horrible one compared to get shorty .
the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind .
i simply failed to find there 's any interest in reading this going nowhere story .
it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie , with all the bore-to-death script , dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap .
how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles , especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose ' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty ' ?
you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose ' ?
and at every corner of los angeles , every table in any restaurant , almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer ' ?
and you have to ask yourself : since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer , even a director in person ?
even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are ?
yeah , maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose ' regularly ?
and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show ?
give me a break !
this book , from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer , so shallow and so superficious !
just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in

gail 's writing is again wonderful in this in book , but i found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure .
i felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character 's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be .
i almost felt as if the writer was n't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic , yet hopeful story .
i can only compare this book to the samurai 's garden since i have n't read a third book by this author yet , and i loved the samari 's garden !
so i was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end .
i am not sorry that i read this book due to the fact that i enjoy the author 's style of writing

i wanted to like this book , but i found it disappointingly thin .
i would n't go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as &quot ; hopeless&quot ; , but it 's certainly superficial : postman seems to rely on secondary sources about enlightenment thought , rather than any deep reading of enlightenment texts .
the idea of &quot ; building a bridge to the 18th century&quot ; seems more like a marketing device , a fresh way of presenting some of postman 's familiar themes , than a serious proposition ( he even includes a summary of his &quot ; disappearance of childhood&quot ; argument in an appendix ) .
it 's a shame , really , because the enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long , and postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what 's good and admirable about contemporary society to enlightened thinking .
for a much more substantial survey and defence of enlightenment thought and culture , read roy porter 's _the creation of the modern world : the british enlightenment_

this book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually no understanding of computer systems by the author .
i do n't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving , but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes , firewalls and hacking techniques , those details must be fairly correct .
in this case , the technical details were so wildly implausible that i finally had to stop reading .
the part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access nsa data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details .
the nsa almost certainly does n't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet ( through any combination of firewalls ) but if they did , they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked .
besides all that that , the characters were cliched and not well developed .
this is all too bad , because the plot was interesting and i would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide

i was anxious to read the reviews on this book and i am happy to find its not just me !
her words and sentences are redundant !
yes " wacky artist " was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages !
liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter !
we know !
do n't tell us 100 times !
this is what i think : either ms. steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...or she 's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing .
is d. steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work ?
also , is it cold stone sober ?
or stone cold sober ?
( it should have been the latter ) no editor caught that mistake ?
i 've been a fan of ms. steel 's work for 21 years now and the past few year 's works have been deplorable !
i first excused it due to the death of her son. .
but her talent never picked up again .
from the ranch onward the books are just pure fluff .
if you want to read a novel and not think about what you 're reading...then read her books , this one especially .
if you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try barbara delinsky , luanne rice , alison clement , susan wiggs. .

it has been said time and again that experience is the best teacher .
antony flew , the world 's number one atheist ( at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments ) has recanted his atheism .
philosophically , flew was a rationalist .
having accepted the empirical evidence of intelligent design in nature , he was able to liberate himself from the tunnel vision of rationalism and hence from the shackles of irrational atheism .
flew himself would give this book one star .
so , i do n't think it ungracious to do the same

having read ( and thoroughly enjoyed ) levitt 's freakonomics , i picked up " hidden order : the economics of everyday life " looking for more of the same .
unfortunately , i was sadly disappointed .
i get the impression the author intended to write a freakonomics-type book , but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material ( located at the end of the book ) .
facing an irate publisher , he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old economics lecture notes .
as a result , readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive , while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use .
( despite the glowing accolades on the cover , the author 's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook .
)

the author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon , but does not provide any answers .
aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students , such tactics are unconscionable .
of course , the author may be priming the pump for sales of a " hidden order supplement " .
a final negative point is the author 's tone , which is frequently condescending towards the reader ( e.g .
telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory , so it will not even be presented ) .
while this may be true for a layperson reading the book , being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter .
overall , if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library , the last 40 pages are worth reading .
otherwise , save your time and money .

if you are going to walt disney world resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions , then this book may not be for you .
some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step-by-step through them , including plot points in 3d movies and so on .
the book also leaves a lot out in other areas , such as dining ( little coverage ) , getting around walt disney world , and off-site hotels and dining .
for me , the unofficial guide to walt disney world ( by bob sehlinger ) was much better at giving me the info i needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides .
that is , it told me what might frighten a youngster , what might bore an adult , and so on , but it did n't say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions .
just generalizations about the ride , then specific warnings for different types of people .
the only things birnbaum offers that the unofficial guide does n't are pictures and info on some of the ancillary activities such as parasailing .
if you have an internet connection , you do n't need the pictures .
and as for the ancillary activities as well as nice maps , you ca n't beat the passporter book on disney world .
so , for me , the unofficial guide plus the passporter yields the best trip planning library for walt disney world .
if you like , you can also pick up the ez-guide , as it also has some interesting maps and info .
as for birnbaum 's , it really does n't have anything to offer .
i would n't recommend against buying it , though , except for the " let me tell you the plot and ending to the movie before you go " mentality .
i hate spoilers , and wish someone had warned me before i started reading this book

mr. friedman 's book begins with an interesting thesis , defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth .
the idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that friedman often well supports with historical facts .
however , the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis , or if he just felt the need to write a book .
furthermore , for every chapter in the book , there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that , with a little thorough thought or research , do n't make sense or can easily be disproven .
with these things being the case , i find friedman 's argument a little hard to buy .
the entire book seems to build up to the final chapter , which friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth ; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely , however , because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book ( ie .
the importance of education ) do not add or support his final policy recommendations .
his policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question " what should the government do to promote economic growth ?
" they do n't push the argument forward or indicate anything that has n't already been suggested in the past , nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies .

for decades , african-american studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side .
for years , " queer " scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side .
this anthology tries to address that void .
it goes a long way in proving that black , gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones .
the anthology has representative numbers of men and women .
in some ways , it 's a who 's who of black gay academia , including works from cathy cohen , dwight mcbride , and jewelle gomez .
still , there is much about this book that frustrated me .
a few years ago , a study was done of black lgbts and most respondents said they hated the term " queer , " yet the academics here champion it .
really , if " queer " is supposed to represent the four groups equally , then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered .
this is surprising given famous black bisexual writers such as alice walker , stuart hall , and june jordan .
often " people of color " is used when only blacks are brought up ; latinos , asians , and native americans barely come up in this book at all .
james baldwin is brought up often here .
i understand that .
his writings were rigorous and often dealt with racial and sexual issues simultaneously .
still , i kept thinking about how bell hooks once wrote that toni morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers wo n't print the works of black women that are equally as sophisticated .
james baldwin deserves his crown in black , gay letters , but i 'm concerned about him being the only one to get to wear a crown .
several books have been printed about the many non-hetero members of the harlem renaissance , yet that group hardly comes up here .
james is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency .
finally , i had beef with many of the essays .
charles nero has great points but his essay is really two works glued together .
can anyone really say the whiteness of new orleans ' " gay ghetto " is due to " chasing amy " or " six feet under " ?
one author could have written quickly about how he supported a gay , feminine student when that student was condemned by a masculine , heterosexual one .
instead , he went on and on in unnecessary jargon and babble .
kara keeling 's essay was 90 % theory and 10 % a discussion of dunye 's " watermelon woman .
" why bother to bring up the film if you 're barely going to discuss it ?
i was n't really feelin ' this text , but that 's not to say it did n't have great aims

in a review remarkable for saying nothing about the book , popop from boston ( april 9 below ) alludes to some children blown up by an ira bomb in a north of england shopping center .
popop is very broad-minded .
it pains him that anyone would bad-mouth such " armed operations " .
they were perfectly justified , he explains , because of thousands of innocent irish catholics murdered at the hands of the british army .
i know why thousands of murders are important to popop .
without them , while he might justify random bombings in his own mind , he could hardly do so in decent company .
but i live in ireland , not america , where news of these murdered thousands has not reached us .
gerry adams never said a word about them , not wishing to be laughed out of the country .
he had to make the most all these years of a dozen fellows caught in a crossfire in derry in 1973 .
i guess he saved the big one for the broad-minded boyos in boston .
what of all those dollars that popop broad-mindedly dropped in the semtex collection box ?
they were not wasted .
thousands of irish really were murdered - mostly not catholics but all of them really dead - at the hands of the disorganization that mr adams always denied being a member of .
to be sure , his non-henchmen failed to terrorize the northern irish into caving in , but his enforcer , who can barely write his own name , did get to be minister of education ( i 'm not making this up ; i could n't ) .
oh , and the book is quite thought-provoking .
there 's a lot about bushes , arabs and the wrong kind of tax-cuts that went over my head .
there 's wit of a subtlety rarely seen since voltaire - you can tell by the capitals and ! ! ! ! .
there are explanations of 9/11 to suit every taste , whichever bush you blame .
myself , i suspect those enrons .
but mr moore did discover :

" there ... is ... no .. .
terrorist .. .
threat !
"

he paid us a flying visit , dined with some ira capos who were laughing up their sleeves , and found the solution to the irish question without breaking sweat : everybody should be nice to each other

investment biker : 1-1/2 stars , just barely escapes the lowest possible rating .
this is a book about what a tom wolfe-style master of the universe does on holiday .
it 's nearly impossible to have an " adventure " when you are carrying 10 ( !
) platinum credit cards .
he got cold and wet a few times , worried about finding gas , did n't always have hotel rooms up to his standards , and had delays at some borders , yawn .
the adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to new york using one of his many visa cards .
i rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the same time mr. rogers was having his " adventure .
" i am stunned that he perceived so little in his long travels .
i do n't know how someone could travel in foreign countries that extensively and end up completely unchanged by the experience .
however , this fits perfectly with his huge arrogance , which is truly the theme of the book .
he already knows it all and will tell you all about it .
which makes one wonder : why did he bother to leave ny city in the first place ?
i guess it was a good opportunity to pose with and boink the attractive and young ( naive and pliable ?
-- certainly lubricious ) daughter of one of his clients .
and a good opportunity to pump himself up by feeling superior to all those " brown faces " he 's driving through .
the arrogance , the arrogance !
typical privileged , right-wing know-it-all .
i 'd like to see him try to survive in the peruvian highlands without all his money and fancy equipment .
this is not a travel book : mr. rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a long economic rant .
you can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his final chapter , " afterword .
" i will summarize his position : governments are bad ; smart , rich guys like me are good ( remember october 1929 ? ) .
many of his predictions are laughably wrong .
he advocated selling the us economy short in 1993 .
look at the us stock market performance from 1993 through 2000 ... gosh !
idiot !
some reviews are touting his prescience on markets .
hello ?
how about his predictions on the biggest economy in the world ?
mr. rogers ' writing is very poor and it 's loaded with cliche 's .
he and tabitha are always zooming on " powerful steeds " into " gorgeous scenery " , or " steep , craggy mountains " into " glitzy , glamorous hotspots " or " delightful , cozy hostels " , or across " hot , empty , flat deserts " into " dumps " that are not up to american standards .
he 'll " describe " one of the greatest mountain chains on earth , the andes , as " the top of the world " ( p. 315 ) for five short sentences and then move on to more important matters like further adventures with border guards and investing .
great writing ?
rubbish !
i think he used a computer program to come up with his " descriptions " of the places he went .
mr. rogers is woefully ignorant about the places he goes - and he does n't learn anything along the way .
he views the world exclusively through the keyhole of economics .
most of the " interesting facts " he mentions about theses places are just wrong .
one indicative example : he describes the moreno glacier in argentina as , " one of the few in the world still moving .
" ( p. 294 ) i found myself laughing out loud many times at his " facts " and descriptions .
if you want to understand the distribution of goods in the world , read " guns , germs , and steel , " by jared diamond .
if you want to read about a real motorcycle trip , read ted simon 's " jupiter 's travels , " or robert fulton 's , " one-man caravan .
"

for good travel books , try : " seven years in tibet " ( harrer ) , " news from tartary " ( fleming ) , " arabian sands " ( thesiger ) , " gypsy moth circles the world " ( chichester ) , " sailing around the world " ( slocum ) , " motoring with mohammed " ( hanson ) , " full tilt " ( murphy ) , " a short walk in the hindu kush " ( newby ) , or " eastern approaches " ( maclean ) " my life with the eskimo " ( stefansson ) , " endurance " ( lansing ) .
i could go on and on .
" investment biker " is poorly-written drivel compared to all these and so many more .
" investment biker , " a classic ?
that 's ridiculous .
from another review : " greatest book on finance , business , travels ever " that comment almost leaves me speechless .
obviously written by someone who has read very few travel books indeed

the case for marriage makes arguments supportive of pres .
bush 's policies on marriage .
however , howard kurtz of the washington post ( 1/26/5 ) reports that maggie gallagher was paid over $ 40,000 by the bush administration to write columns and a " private " report supporting its $ 300 million hhs marriage initiative .
mr. kurtz reports that ms. gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers , writing " i should have disclosed a government contract when i later wrote about the bush marriage initiative .
i would have , if i had remembered it .
" she also states she was " aware vaguely " that her work was federally funded .
it must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $ 40,000 .
bad memory , vagueness , national column : what will we say to the children ?
i wonder who paid ms. gallagher to write this book

i was lured into reading under the volcano after seeing its inclusion on the modern library 's one hundred best of the 20th century and after reading a reviewer compare it to james joyce ( i am an amateur joycean who tries to read ulysess , portrait of the artist , and dubliners at least annually ) .
lowry has nothing that likens him to joyce .
this book is leaden and tedious .
i forced myself to finish it because i hate to start a book and not finish it .

this is not one of lonely planet 's best guides .
there is suprisingly little information .
for example , the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services .
basically , everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in rekyavik , which luckily is run very well .
i found this really disappointing since iceland is very expensive and i was hoping to keep down costs ( in reality this is almost impossible , even eating at the grocery store i was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese ) furthermore , iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details .
as with any tour book some of the info is out of date .
some of the museums and businesses were closed including the icelandic phallogical museum .
it also seemed that this book was written for the high season in the summer months .
i went in march and found the information on the offseason limited and sometimes inaccurate .
i usually trust lonely planet but in this case i would have tried one of the other guide book companies or simply visit the tourist center when you get there .

i think the linda howard who wrote white lies , sarah 's child , duncan 's bride , mackenzies mountain , diamond bay,etc .
is one of the most talented current romance writers .
unfortunately , when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the " big time " , her writing started to decline .
she is clearly in over her head now .
what a shame she could n't stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers .
this just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it .
this is pure " peter principle " in action .

that so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me .
luckily , i bought this book used , otherwise i might be kicking myself for paying full price .
between her utterly uninspired " devotional dances " to things such as sex , wisdom , and the " sticky one " ( a term she made up for the astral body ) , and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to " anoint " it , i was unimpressed , to say the least .
however , driving on a trip a friend and i got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book .
it 's very , very amusing if you do n't take it seriously .
the thing that makes me sad is that she 's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth .
there 's nothing evolutionary about it , unless you consider being a wanton , idiotic freak " evolutionary " .
if this is what humanity is evolving into , i am frightend

unlike cussler 's other series , i found this first story of the " oregon files " slow going at first and rather confusing .
there are just too many things going on ( no problem , i suppose , for multi-taskers !
) and way too many characters to keep track of .
also , there 's little to no character development even of " mr. chairman " , juan cabrillo .
the fact that he and his companions are mercenaries ( with a penchant for good deeds that pay well ) does n't compare favorably with the numa heroes .
however , the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides i expect from mr. cussler and co-writers .
i look forward to the subsequent oregon files with high hopes .

sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing the guardian .
this book is awful .
the storyline is weak and predictable , the dialogue is excruciatingly lame , and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry .
there is virtually no romance , which is the reason to read sparks ' books .
i ca n't tell you how many times i rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said , the way the dog seems to be human , and the predictability of the plot .
this book is so poorly written and so lame i have trouble believing sparks wrote it .
if you want a good plot with romance mixed in , read message in a bottle or a walk to remember .
if you want suspense , read mary higgins clark or agatha christie ; they do a far better job with it than sparks does .

i read this book and i think presented material is not practical in commercial applications .
in my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications .
i know this is something different from contracts , by i think contracts are to complex , hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems .
for me another problem with contracts is problem in describing complex constraint that exists in problem domain .
for example how to describe that objects must be cloned , not passed by reference or how to check that objects holded by readonly list not change their state during operations on list ?

some may disagree , and in fact , many have asked me why i disliked this one so much ; so , here is why :

- scratch 'plotting'... by this point in the story , 'plodding ' is more accurate .
- caracatures over characters .
a staple of the series , 2d characters ; but by this point , when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story , it becomes an annoyance , a drag and overkill .
- virtually zero gain .
the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission , once accomplished ( or not ) is forgotten by the end of the book .
the third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original lb premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments ; sadly , it 's very boring and slow .
however.. .

-... the book does n't get good until the last fourth .
and that , my friends , is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series .
by this point , it 's obvious that the authors were really stretching it .
however , as i said , things got really good in the last few chapters and led into 'armageddon ' , one of the best books in the series .
how ironic .
thumbs way down for left behind : the remnant .
it 's sad when the best part of the book is a scene involving the antichrist sunbathing on a rooftop .

... and the maps are worthless .
two examples of the many glaring inaccuracies contained in this book :
1 ) rick claims you can pick up a bus map in any tourist information kiosk .
the following is an actual transcript of our conversation with the tourist info lady :
us : buon giorno .
do you speak english ?
info lady : of course .
us : we 'd like to go to vatican city .
may we have a bus map please ?
info lady : a bus map ?
for roma ?
us : um , yes .
info lady : no such thing exists .
2 ) rick claims you can see everything you want to see in the vatican in one morning : st. peter 's basilica , the vatican museums , the sistine chapel - everything .
um , rick ?
have you ever been there ?
did you notice the 40,000 other people there all trying to get in to the same things ?
did you notice the priceless and beautiful works of art on practically every surface ?
did it occur to you that people might , perhaps , want to stop and admire a large number of them ?
light a candle ?
say a prayer ?
some of us , also , have to behind a crowd of 35 elderly germans to look at michaelangelo 's pieta , and everything else .
methinks ol ' rick either spends an average of 15 minutes apiece on the most astonishing and pleasurable spots in rome , or is comfortable elbowing foreign senior citizens in the ribs

gives many examples of weapons , most of which are useful .
gives no/few examples of rings/armours/rods/staffs/shields

does n't really think out a lot of the bonuses , also i question a lot of the penalties one has to take to use a legacy weapon .
about the only table worth taking is 4-1 , or 4-2 .
sure its a minus three to your saves , and a minus 2 to your attack power , and a whole slew of hp .
the rest of them are so painful they are n't worth taking .
also all the caster " tables " the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right does n't make any sense .
no matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it .
those could have been more thought out .
also i question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables , a , d , and g. seem to be a lot better than the b , e and h tables just from the way they interact with things .
i do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your legacy item is quite powerful , the i table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them .
what i wish/want was if they 're was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two i table skills .
also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid .
the rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers .
are very well thought out and are very powerful .
yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable .
in a caster heavy campaign like the one i run and participate in its a very low value book

i keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are , but i have never found this to be so .
he always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it .
he seems more at home studying statistics ( which he includes everywhere ) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics .
i always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper , surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world .
all his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later .
still lots of people think he is grea

guess what--there 's zero information about the hemingway haunting in this book !
in addition , old ataulfo of madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic 's version of handel 's halleluja chorus .
instead , what 's offered here is a rehash of old stories ( and old theories about what ghosts could be ) with insipid , comic book illustrations .
why this is called a &quot ; field guide&quot ; with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds , plants , or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists .

leaving the racism issue aside , this is not a book for small children .
even if everything turns out ok in the end , i 'm not prepared to expose my children to issues of capital punishment and the drowning death of a small boy .
small children forget the ending and focus on the scary parts in between .
perhaps i 'm a softie , but let 's allow them to be children and not worry about being wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by beheading .
just because it 's a classic does n't make it appropriate reading .

racism is not the problem with this book - sure...5 chinese brothers look alike -maybe they look alike because they are brothers , not because they are chinese .
i bought this book because generally i love the books written in earlier times - they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time .
this book does have engaging illustrations .
what i find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet :

( 1 ) a little boy drowns , never to be seen again
( 2 ) one brother is tried , arrested and sentenced to have his head cut off
( 3 ) the people of the village assemble in the village to witness the execution where the " executioner took his sword and struck a mighty blow "
( 4 ) the next brother was sentenced to be drowned and was thrown overboard from a boat
( 5 ) the next brother is sentenced to be burned alive - he was tied up to a stake and set fire
( 6 ) the next brother is sentenced to be suffocated - he 's shovelled into an oven

this is no more appropriate for a child ( or adult for that matter ) in 1936 than it is in 2005 .
now , a lot of you are probably thinking i 'm one of those mothers who just needs to get a sense of humour and lighten up .
i 'm not...i love the giving tree , and can put naughty eloise ( and the smoking nanny ) in context , as i can many other books that polarise readers .
i really wanted to like this book but trust me....if you buy it , you will have lots of uncomfortable explaining to do to a young child .
an eight year old may be able to put it in context , but there is no way you should read this to a four year old .
if you want a great book written in the 1930s , buy ferdinand the bull instead .
it 's a fantastic book .

first i have to admit , i only read 150 pages of this book .
that was all i could possibly stand .
life is just too short to waste on a book you do n't enjoy reading .
ballas , our main character , is a drunk and a scoundrel .
one is not sure whether they should root for or against him .
he is a vagrant , thief , and all around not so nice guy .
he steals a mysteriously beautiful gemstone , which sets into motion something........i got too bored to stick around and find out what .
the first 150 pages are filled with ballas being beaten within an inch of his life , coming to , healing enough to move on , only to be beaten within an inch of his life again .
ok , we get it , let 's get on with the story .
i just got too bored to stay with this one folks .
maybe it got better , but to me , if an author ca n't write well enough to grab and maintain my attention , their book is n't worth my time .

mr. cahills book offers an interesting and controversial take on history .
he is an excellent and compelling writer , but his differentiation between pre and post diaspora israelites when discussing the celts in several of his books is not always clear .
it was only the post-babylonian diaspora southern kingdom israelites who came to be known as jews , around 500 bc .
it was the post-assyrian diaspora ( 721 bc ) of the larger ten-tribed northern kingdom israelites who became what we today call the celts .
it is they who are both the island celts who populated ireland , scotland , wales , etc. , and their cousins , the continental celts who sacked the roman empire under many celtic tribal names and who make up most of northwest europe today .
the author could perhaps clarify this part of his presentations on european history by reviewing losttribes.net or any other modern celtic site based on contemporary archeology .

roberts ' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better .
based on the theories of david ricardo , the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible .
in the choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt ceos .
fables like the choice ( or the " free-market economy " for that matter ) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple .
that 's why the book is dangerous .
the choice has almost nothing to do with the real world , but it sounds good .
the argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable .
if you buy roberts ' version of ricardo , however , you must accept wal-mart as the epitome of business virtue .
roberts may be a great guy , and he certainly writes well .
unfortunately , his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple , elegant , and horribly wrong

i 've read all of nevada barr 's anna pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until i reached hard truth .
after writing so many intellligent , suspenseful stories , barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime .
murder 's not nasty enough ?
how about the murder of children ?
still not gruesome enough ?
add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture .
ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains , but really , who cares ?
the kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal .
it 's like bad language in humor--in general , it 's just a cover for bad writing .
in hard truth , barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness , in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable : the charm and intelligence of her main charcter , the well-reasoned defense of nature , the lush descriptions of each story 's setting .
i found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable .
i give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character ( a recently paralyzed ice climber ) , but otherwise i 'm sorry i spent my time and money on it

i picked this book up , thinking it would be on par with all the ja jance books i 've read previously .
what a crashing disappointment .
i ca n't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told , i kept looking at the cover to see if i 'd picked up a harlequin by mistake .
i 'll probably read more ali reynolds books if this is indeed a new series , but i 'd much rather see what happens with jp and joanna - incidentally , i did n't think much of either of them , either , when their paths crossed some books ago .
this one gets a big " aw , c'mon , ja , you can do much better than this !
" from me .
for those who have n't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first jaj , get the jp beaumonts and start at the beginning .

considering that this is virtually the first attempt ( as far as i know ) at a dictionary of the pentecostal/charismatic movement , this is a good start .
it is worth the price for what it does contain but it is not without glaringflaws.the title &quot ; international&quot ; leads one to expect much more coverage of pentecost outside of the u.s. canada , where pentecostal movements thrived in parallel with those in the u.s. , is given very scanty treatment.some major early canadian apostles , such as o.j .
lovik , are skipped entirely .
there is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize .
a balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer , rather than by the leaders of those movements.finally , there is too much credence and space given to sociological assessments of a movement that requires , above all else , keen spiritual discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff .
that said , i will consult my copy often , for the great amount of useful material it does contain

why does he have to live in france ?
why does n't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers ?
so many questions .
people just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say james michenier because it was banned .
it was banned because it 's a bad book

mr. winchester takes an interesting subject , collects enough material to make a fine article in , say , national geographic , and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length .
( case in point , a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid , but loses it , and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss .
ick .
self-induldgent .
boring .
) worse , still , even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material , such as relates , say , to the subject 's wife , all mr. winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations .
i guess extensive research might have been too time consuming .
numerous times i considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful , but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going , hence my review of two stars .
john mcphee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than mr. winchester , and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story

while i applaud ms. lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of janie hendrix 's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit , there are some very serious credibility problems here .
while even the idle hendrix fan knows jimi was born in king county hospital , ( now harbor view ) lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend .
( ouch ) jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so 'no one can profit from them'.meanwhile cigarette packs ( yes , cigarette packs ) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to hendrix ,siting ms. lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity .
at one point she aledgedly quotes hendrix as saying :

" the lsd passed around san francisco was a fabulous discovery for me , i 'd taken acid in london but.... "

aside from jimi 's use of the word 'fabulous ' being at best incredulous , the fact that hendrix had already tried lsd in new york in 1996 before going to england and subsequently monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable .
those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors , official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book , and the credibility of it 's author are based on , extremely suspect .
at one point ms. lawrence even offers an aledged quote from hendrix 's mother who passed away in 1958 :

" jimi baby " she told her son " i have to escape this "

while quotes like this can illicit an emotional response
from the average reader,they are clearly fictional .
throughout the book people close to jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted , if at all .
i shared the recount of jimi 's trip to berkeley as a small child ( pg.5 ) with jimi 's aunt delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories .
this from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip .
while making a reference to ernestine benson and misstakenly referring to her husband cornel as " bill " , lawrence again allegedly quotes hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the benson 's who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the hendrix 's .
lawrence 's assertion that hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than jimi 's adopted stepsister janie 's claim that jimi did n't od .
lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for monika 's suicide , but the jist is clear .
this book is more than a bit narcissistic with lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject .
while proclaiming herself to be a close confident of hendrix ' the general consensus is that she was n't around that much , if people even know who she is at all .
for a much more well researched and credible look into jimi 's life read electric gypsy or even more so , the new book room full of mirrors by charles cross .
the man , the magic , the truth , while very dramatic , is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject , not a biography or a reliable historical record .
unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available , their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned .

bought this one for evolution class .
it is a horrible excuse for a textbook .
do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student .
if the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience , then i would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend university of washington

while i did find the book informative and a good supplement to robert sobel 's the great bull market : wall street in the 1920s , galbraith interjects his sarcastic view of the participants in the 1920s bull market way too much .
this makes parts of the book extremely difficult to read .
while i persevered to the end , i fouynd sobel 's account as informative and much more enjoyable to read

</review_text>
<review_text>

i was very disapointed by this book .
after just finishing the 400 + pages book " bull !
from maggie mahar " which is an absolute ecxellent book about market cycles ( although the more recent boom of 1982-1999 ) , " the great crash " was really hard to read .
it totally shows its age ( it was written more than 50 years ago ) .
the language is hard to understand and some words seem weird in todays time .
but its not just the language which makes this book not enjoyable .
it is not written with much entertainment value , and the book i mentioned earlier shows clearly that it is quite possible to write an very entertaining book about the stock market .
it also is very superficial , it does n't go into much detail at all .
it does n't tell any examples of real people or anything which would make the book more readable .
it lists names and companies without doing a good part of explaning why it lists them .
sometimes i was thinking to myself " please get to your point .
"

that book was probably a good read in 1955 while people still could relate to most of the names he lists .
but now ( 2004 ) there must be better books out there about the crash of 1929 .
i give it two stars and not one ( you ca n't give zero stars ) because it has some interesting facts .
overall i would not recommend this book .
try another one about this subject

i have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title .
as others have pointed out , coughlin 's ego can be suffocating at times .
this could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw .
alas it is not .
the writing is amateurish at best and the author 's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting .
the language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus .
again this could be forgiven as we 're reading this book for a soldier 's account , not that of an english grad student .
this book offers a stark contrast in comparison with nathaniel fick 's " one bullet away .
" whereas fick seems to be an intelligent , thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men , coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else .
he is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company .
you can not know a person from reading their writing but coughlin 's character development is very superficial .
his attempts to convey a " human side " are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived .
this is a great contrast to the character development in " one bullet .
" there is no connection between author and reader in " shooter .
" coughlin does not develop the role players either .
in " one bullet " you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer , his ncos and the enlisted men .
additionally , coughlin 's demeaning descriptions of his support staff ( non-trigger pullers ) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic .
to make matters worse the action is n't as well developed as in other titles .
the author 's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits , with plenty of after-action chest thumping , obscures the view of battle .
he spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft , training and shooting .
this can be found elsewhere .
overall this book was a great disappointment .
if only a fraction of coughlin 's self-acclaimed exploits are true , then he is a remarkable sniper .
he should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them

the beginning of this book was excellent , but dont be fooled , the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book .
the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers .
what 's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were .
this was one of the worst books i have ever read , i 'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery .
dont waste your time reading it

several reviews of this book , published elsewhere , stress
the contents of rossi 's analysis were more focused toward
the skeptical side of egyptian math and construction methods .
rossi , therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing new information within unproven paradigms .
on the math side , rossi mentions fibonacci 's algorithm
and phi , two paradigms that clearly were not used in ancient
egypt , though many like to suggest that they were .
the
fibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and j.j .
sylvester 's skeptical views of the rmp 's 2/nth table , are
reference point to 1202 ad and the liber abaci , but not
a reference point of egypt .
egypt used more subtle ideas
like http : //egyptianmath.blogspot.com and http : //akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com .
yet , hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that ahmes in 1650 bc
easily wrote out 2/p series into short and concise unit
fraction series using a very simple partitioning method
( as ahmes wrote out n/p answers in his 'false position '
algebra problems , ie .
5/19 written out in a long awkward
series using 1/12th as the first partition , as he did for 2/19 ,
as describe a couple paragraphs below .
ahmes wrote 5/19

per , 5/19 - 1/12 = ( 60 - 19 ) / ( 12 * 19 ) = ( 38 + 2 + 1 ) / ( 12 * 19 )

or , 5/19 = 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/114 + 1/228 ) .
clearly modern scholars ( two being robins-shute ) have often suggested that 'false supposition ' was used by ahmes , hinting
that ahmes guessed at his answers .
ahmes never guessed !
ahmes '
answers were always exact when he worked with rational numbers .
moderm scholars were the ones that had guessed , and missed , finding ahmes deeper methods .
interestingly no scholar , until
very recently , has claimed to have read ahmes ' shorthand
notes .
modern scholars had sadly filled inlogical gaps left
by ahmes with their own intellectual guesses - many of which
have been proven to be wrong ( as rossi had not learned , since
he referenced none of the controversial eguptian fraction and weights and measures issues ) .
bruins also discovered the hultsch method in 1945 , and today
the method is named the hultsch-bruin method .
it says that

2/p = 1/a + ( 2a -p ) /ap

where a , a highly divisible number selected in the range

p/2 &lt ; a &lt ; p

with the divisors of a uniquely added to ( 2a -p )
thereby solving ( 2a-p ) /ap .
example ,

2/19 = 1/12 + ( 24 -19 ) / ( 12 * 19 )

= 1/12 + ( 3 + 2 ) / ( 12 * 19 )

= 1/12 + 1/76 + 1/114

with the ( 4 + 1 ) alternative being discarded
since its last denominator was too large .
rossi also mentions that egyptian division may have followed
an inverse operation of its multiplication 'doubling ' method .
here also rossi did not seen the simple remainder arithmetic
found in rmp # 62 where 100/13 = 7 + 9/13 = 7 + 2/3 + 1/39 .
generally ahmes and all scribes divided by this q = quotient
and r = remainder method .
the akhmim wooden tablet even
shows a special method for grain and volume division where
a hekat unity 64/64 was divided by n , with n &lt ; 64 , as

( 64/64 ) /n = q/64 + r/ ( n * 64 )

even more interesting , ahmes also used this method to
divide 100 hekat by 70 , with his final form matching
the akhmim wooden tablet 's special use of ro = 1/320th
of a hekat , by :

( 6400/64 ) /70 = 91/64 + 30/ ( 70 * 64 )

and introducing ro = 1/320 of a hekat ,

= ( 1 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 ) /64 = ( 150/70 ) * 1/320

= 1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ( 2 + 1/7 ) * ro

i 'll not go on and discuss rossi ' view of egyptian
architecture being the above her standard cambridge
skeptical comments .
overall , many accept rossi 's view as informative ,
and i do as well , in limited areas .
however , on the
math side of rossi 's quick use of a sylvester 's and
other recent skeptical techniques , all disproven years ago ,
shows that her cambridge training needs to be expanded
to read the egyptian mathematical texts .
clearly ahmes
and his brother/sister scribes are the only experts
that should guide our understanding of egyptian math .

i give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that nicholas wade has presented and in the manner it was presented , " dna and the secret family of thomas jefferson .
"
this most difinitive " unproven " statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he " seems " to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the jefferson-hemings dna study and for what " reason " he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers .
he seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the jefferson-hemings controversy .
unless i overlooked it , i saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist spencer wells is performing for national geographic socity .
i assisted this study by providing access to jefferson dna sources .
the result of a match was found in the early phoenicians , ( caanites mentioned in the bible ) and in lands that today are syria and lebanon .
from what i know of the study ( i assisted dr. e.a .
foster with the dna study ) , mr. wade 's analysis of this is extremely limited , in fact , it is extremely biased .
" thomas jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress sally hemings " ( pg 257 ) .
what truthful fact does he have to give this statement ?
he makes the most of giving details by lying james callender and lying samuel wetmore/madison hemings in pike co. , ohio .
why the details in a book topic such as this ?
i will give you serious readers on the serious dna topic my opinion .
as you may see in my several reviews of other biased books , these authors know nothing of the details of the dna study but spread old early biased media tales .
he did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars ( 13 senior professors ) for the scholars commission ( [ ... ] ) and determined that there is no proof that jefferson is guilty of these charges .
you may read on my web page : www.angelfire.com/va/tjtruth all the details of this study .
he can not plead ignorance of the details because i sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion .
can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge .
my knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited , but i do know this jefferson-hemings study and he has done no current or original research .
he references annette gordon-reed as some type of " authority " on the controversy .
she was charged by the scholars commission report as having completely rearranged a letter from jefferson 's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words .
to add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking , wade has a figure with the title , " thomas jefferson family with sally hemings. ( pg.260-261 ) .
" his lack of knowledge of sally hemings and thomas jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that martha jefferson and sally hemings are half-sisters ( an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct .
he does not mention a very scholarily book by dr. and mrs. james mcmurry , " anatomy of a scandal , thomas jefferson and the sally story " , who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging .
since he did not give the reader another source for study , another very interesting book , " jefferson vindicated , falacies , omissions,and contradictions in the hemings genealogical search " , i will tell you it has a foreword by former monticello director , james a , bear , jr. all of the named books , including , " the jefferson-hemings myth " are available through amazon .
i do agree with wade 's last sentence on the jefferson-hemings controversy....... " some mysteries lie beyond the power of even dna to resolve .
" i might add that contrived history is intertwined with dna and even the hemings will not permit the gathering of " another " hemings dna source.....only one originally tested .

if you admired the young mccourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in angela 's ashes ( a'sa ) , this book is sure a huge deception .
the first 80 pages are a great continuation to a'sa , but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops , as if mccourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas .
the storyline becomes chaotic , changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again , no order or sense whatsoever .
what 's worse , nice and naive mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father , constant beating up of women included .
it 's a huge shock ( hey this story 's real , folks !
) ; it 's as if snow white suddenly turned into the role of the queen .
mccourt wo n't be the same nice , brave and funny guy for me nevermore .

like the other posters , i too was given this book as part of our homestudy for adopting a child from china .
after reading the first chapter i found myself insulted .
this book assumes all who read it are adopting because they can not get pregnant , which is not my case .
while infertility is something that should not be ignored , and i appreciate the fact that most adoption books i read address the matter , this book would have been much more respectable if it did not direct its text to the reader as a person who can not conceive .
i was so insulted that i returned the book to my social worker with these concerns

i have long had the desire to read a grisham book , because i have heard good things .
well , my chance came and i was sorely disappointed .
the audio cd 's were on sale at a truck stop and i decided to get them for the chamber .
the opening to the book kept me going , but by chapter three , i had already decided this , " if sam cayhall lives i 'm going to be mad because i get furious about hate crimes , and if he dies , he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the " hero " to the story .
" sadly , i pursued curious about the ending .
i 'm very glad i got the cds instead of the book , because it only took six hours to get through it .
sure wish i had those six hours back and the money invested so i could try a diferent author .
mayber grisham 's other books are better , but i wo n't be reading them

we live in a man 's world .
women are raped , abused , beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification .
this is an epidemic problem , and christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population .
so here comes another book on male sexuality , for christian men .
the idea is good : rein in the beast .
but the major defect , which sinks the book , is the self-centered nature of the remedy .
christian men are given a toolkit to not look at booty .
what we are not given is a concrete understanding of compassion .
it 's all self-centered .
who cares if the world is just as dangerous for our wives , daughters , and loved ones ?
at least i 'm " sexually pure .
"

surely sexual purity includes overthrowing the sexual aggression in society at large ?
this is a life and death situation .
we will be successful according to the goals we set .
it is not enough for men to stop lusting .
we need to fundamentally change the sexual ethics of our society - ethics that are n't greatly concerned with women 's well-being .
if you 're only concerned with your own thoughts , this book could be useful .
but what about the sense of security for the women in our society , who have to live with sexual aggression , cat-calls and " hey-baby " s ?
this book sets shamefully low standards for the church 's role in reshaping society , even as it sets admirably high standards for individual men 's thought-lives

the principle question that arises from a reading of &quot ; soul by soul&quot ; by walter johnson is why was this book written ?
it is touted as history , yet not only does it lack any original historical material , it also lacks any discernable historical facts .
rather than history , &quot ; soul by soul&quot ; seems to be a mean-spirited , emotional tract designed to promote two fundamental ideas : 1. that white people living in the antebellum south were universally loathsome , brutish and cruel and 2. that black people living in the antebellum south were universally noble , good and abused .
to support his views , professor johnson strings together a loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings .
his personal contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche of the book 's long deceased characters and divine their true , but unspoken , motives and thoughts .
quite a feat for any historian !
one loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using their &quot ; probing fingers&quot ; in this book .
fortunately , in between probes , the reader can be shocked by the &quot ; killing fields of the lower south,&quot ; the &quot ; historical sexualization of black bodies,&quot ; the &quot ; slaveholders ' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves,&quot ; and the &quot ; brutish perogatives of whiteness.&quot ; this is heavy , hate-filled stuff worthy of a tv mini-series but it is out of place in a supposedly serious history text .
i live in a former slave quarter in new orleans .
in the antebellum period , this building and its resident slaves were , interestingly enough , owned by a free black who was financially ruined in 1863 by the emancipation proclamation .
as an amateur historian , i would have thought that a book about the new orleans slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these markets .
what were their addresses ?
what percentage of their customers were black ?
what percentage were white ?
how many slaves did the typical new orleans household have ?
how were they fed and clothed ?
what were their working hours ?
these are basic questions that should have been addressed but instead , the reader is given an emotionally charged , repetitious , boring rehash of tired , previously published material .
in short , this book , for the most part , reads like a rambling , overly long sermon .
anyone seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the &quot ; slave narratives&quot ; compiled by the federal writers project , &quot ; time on the cross&quot ; by robert fogel and stanley engerman and &quot ; the slave trade&quot ; by hugh thomas .
the first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves performed by the w.p.a .
in the 1930 's .
the latter two works contain original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery , not the emotions

sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of cosulting business .
but then , for the price of this book , i would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as consulting for dummies .
the book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant ; but come on , consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural , systematic yet creative thinking .
overall , i think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant .
while for beginner , the reader will risk the wrong impression that it 's this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world

another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation.. .
if you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...unfortunately they do n't come with disclaimers .
like one would get when reading a book on the occult... people tend to go for books that support their bigoted view , and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it... .
it is a living .
when the da vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot 's guide to the code , how to interpret the code etc etc... .
i am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the ny times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad.. .

a biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors ( or killed and maimed ) of iwo experienced .
he saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice .
by strict definition , this act was deserving of the medal of honor .
his terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching , but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of iwo veterans , or any other battle , i have read .
the other accounts i have read generally conclude : war is a horrible thing to experience , and not glorious , but " i would do it again......... " .
the recent books i have read will illustrate this contrast :
" goodbye , darkness " , william manchester
" god is not here..... " , richard overton
" the quiet hero " , gary w. toyn
" flags of our fathers " , james bradley
" the last lieutenant " , john shively
these men may have entered combat as boys , but they certainly left as men .

this book states that it 's better to die than survive a rape :

" also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity .
once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained .
even in a forced contact such as rape or incest , the injured one is greatly outraged .
if she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed , she is of course in a more favorable position .
there is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation .
it is better to die in defending one 's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle .

this story should have and could have been really good .
it presents a great concept , but the story is just so poorly crafted .
it is very sexist , the prose is stiff , and the plot is dull .
i will concede that it was interesting at times ; it kept me reading , but i really did n't get much out of it .
i can only praise heinlein for including the " intelligent conversation " which takes place after the press conference , where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn .
the whole story is just very odd .
do read it though .
it 's a title to read if you wish to be considered " well read .
" despite its faults , valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten , just as we will never forget atticus from " to kill a mockingbird .

sometime ago i read my sunday paper and noted that " three junes " was listed as a popular book choice .
the title sounded interesting so i bought it .
that was 2 months ago and i am still trying to get through the paperback edition .

i will finish the book because that 's my style .

sadly this second book left me unsatisfied .
for one , wouk 's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second .
of course , once one has read through the first book , its hard to stop .
yet , by the end of war and remembrance i was thoroughly sick and annoyed by wouk 's characters .
it 's hard to relate to super humans , who constantly do super human feats .
most of the characters in the book come from superior stock , graduate from the top universities , have extremely good looks , and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane .
i guess after spending endless hours reading the book i am somewhat frustrated .
perhaps you will be like me , and by the second book without pausing .
but , for the sake of saving some time , i recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one .
do n't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good .

the author is brilliant , not to mention right on the things he says .
it 's just that the writer 's style is so abstract and nebulous that he 's absolutely maddening to try and follow .
one moment , he 'll be talking about how religion evolved , and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask , " what in the world is he saying now ?
" i got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense , and then noticed how he drifted here and there , making good points and then totally abandoning them .
i bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because i had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it ! !
it never seemed to get better .
i gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of , but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author !
overall , i really can not recommend it unless you are a very slow , contemplative reader who does n't mind an unorthodox read .
other than that , the book is packed with some good info .
i just wish i could have gotten to it more easily .

like everyone of you , i am crazy about my toddler .
i got this book and the book of wendy s. masi ' toddlers play .
the comarison : day and night .
kuffners book might have 365 activities , but it really bad organized .
i am a first time parent , so i need some help/guidance ; thsi is why i baught this bbok .
there is nothing to guide me on which activity is for what age group , so i do n't know if an activity is for 18 months or 24 or 12 months- ie ami challenging my toddler , am i boring him or ami providing him with the right fun activity for his age ? ? ?
some of the activities are too obvious- it seems like the author wrote down anything she could think of just to fill in 365 activities in the bookl and there is you see the author 's luck of creativity and/or knowledge of the subject .
also the descriptiosn are very brief with limited illustrations .
i really do n't understand why anyone will give 5 stars to this book .
i do n't care about the money i spent for the book .
i care that i ended up with something that i can not really use to provide my toddler with fun .
for that reason i strongly recommend the othe rbook ( wendy s. masi 's book ) .
yes it has 100 instea dof 365 activities , but it is colorfull , easy and pleasant to read and each activity is marked by an ege indicator .
look at the 'look inside ' of both these books and you will see what i mean .
good luck + have lost of fun with your toddler ( s ) !

without question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and steve allen 's pivitol role it .
sadly ben alba 's " inventing late night : steve allen and the original " tonight show' ' , is not that book .
it is , largely , a poorly edited and self-contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with allen 's tv contemporaries .
these interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers scott berg ( sam goldwin ) or neal gabler ( walter winchle ) .
the opening chapter , which addresses allen 's dysfuntional up-bring , education and his early days in radio and tv sets the stage for the author 's failure to create a full-blooded , well-rounded analytical portrait of allen and his work .
alba draws here , almost exclusively and certainly uncritically , from allen 's memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews .
taking allen and the reader 's one independent witness at face value , allen had a rootless , violent and unstable childhood .
given these negative conditions alba gives no hint of how , why or even if , allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family .
the author gives us two brief stories from allen 's adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured .
actually , all the stories show is that allen attended an uncle 's funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his sunday night show .
how did this dysfunctional world of allen 's youth effect his two marriages and five sons ?
why , after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did allen choose this same career field for himself ?
alba does n't even pose such questions about the boy 's effects on the man .
he just plows ahead in a haliographic haze .
throughout " inventing... " alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance allen 's words .
no other witnesses are called , no other points of view are examined .
steve tells a story ; alba accepts it and edits it into his text .
why not read allen straight ?

it truly is the best war fiction regarding wwii if you have never read any other fiction regarding wwii .
i love war fiction and non-fiction and beside parroting the time magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel i can not even come close to understanding why anyone , let alone review after review , would even come close to that stupefying conclusion .
to me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with .
only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating .
what it is , is a bloated , narcisstic , misogynistic waste of time .
of course any piece of literature is subjective , but to me , this critically acclaimed work fails on every level that a novel should , regardless of genre .
unless you love james joyce ( another bad writer lorded over us by the critically elite ) , i think most readers expect some sort of plot development .
do n't expect that here .
how about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel ?
you better pick up something else .
it seems to me the reader should at least be invested in one of the character 's outcome .
far too pedestrian a thought if you " get " this art .
if i ca n't have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely likable ?
forget it non-ivy leaguer !
i was rooting for the japanese to kill them all , so at least their " loved " ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally despicable human beings .
the only thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the painful experience of reading these soldier 's hateful ruminations while , oh by the way , a war was being fought around them .
nope , no big ending either .
it just ends .
yes , i have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the entire book is to symbolize war itself .
give me a break .
while this may be bad news for us common folk duped into reading it , it certainly is good news for tom clancy .
his last two decades of literature are just misunderstood genius depicting the banality of human existence and not bad writing at all .

communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history , responsible for the extermination of 100 + million people .
this book ( which started it all ) holds at least much of the blame .
communists were and still are a threat to the free world , and communism is a slave system .
some " intellectuals " actually support the tired mantras of marx 's philosophy , whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who have n't seen enough sunlight , i do n't know .
in any case , if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property , and is totalitarian and slave-driving ( the government owns everything , including you ) .
and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up .
pol pot , mao , stalin ( of course ) , etc etc...who are these people kidding

agree that its missing the tools techniques and concepts but he made it clear up front he was not going into it .
also , the intergration knowledge area is missing .

this book irritated me on many levels ; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak .
in fact , the plot , the premise , the writing were good--unfortunately the characters did n't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable .
i read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book .
in this book , i was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story.. .

i ca n't remember the last time i failed to finish reading a novel .
i abandoned this one with 100 pages to go .
with another implausible plot twist , i 've had enough .
maybe i 've been spoiled by the quality of character driven fiction from george pelecanos , james lee burke , robert b parker , james sallis , scott phillips , and robert crais but i suspect that this is not just a failure to connect with the characters and more to do with poor writing .
i 've read quite a number of deaver 's novels and enjoyed the complex plots and the exploration of psychologically/psyciatrically devient chbaracters , but this is just over the top .
when i came to the chapter that excplained how the magician faked his death while in custody , that was enough .
i have another fifty novels lined up waiting to be read and i 'll be damned if i 'm going to waste any more time on this poor one .
for that matter , after six or so lincoln rhyme novels , i ca n't say that i really know or care anything about lincoln or saches

i have been a huge fan of dean koontz for years , ever since my mom got me to read watchers .
but this story is just way too slow .
just when i thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again .
i almost put it down halfway through the book , but i kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner .
about 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but i just felt like something was missing most of the time i was reading .
i just could n't get into the characters .
i would n't recommend this book to any first time dean koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....do n't judge his work by this novel .

there is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely .
" oil is more dense than water-- and that 's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212 " .
as a chemist and formulator i can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water , and even if it were n't that 's * not * the reason it has a higher boiling point .
ever make oil & vinegar salad dressing ?

i was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of paris , a city i have visited often .
the book fell far short of that .
it left me disappointed and longing for what i had missed .
it was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject .
as an example , she tells us that moving within paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth .
where were her feelings , little experiences , failings , successes , reactions .
overall , the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it .

i could n't even finish reading this book .

the whole talking car concept was , frankly , just stupid .
this was like watching an episode of knight rider , but without david hasselhoff .
the characters are flat , and the dialogue is stilted and contrived .

do n't sell it to one country on microfilm for a lot of money , sell it to everybody in hard cover for ~ $ 20.00 a pop .
somebody is going to have to explain to me the difference between what risen has done here , and what the walkers were imprisoned for .
imagine a wwii era reporter , during the war , giving away that the allies had broken the kreigsmarine enigma code in order to challenge how much money was spent doing it ; or how we used false signals to test japanese intentions in the run-up to midway just to question whether we correctly evaluated the information ; or disclosed the exact d-day landing beaches in a vain attempt to substitute their own " expert " opinion .
james risen 's product is the same thing , only with a snarkier monday-morning-quarterback vibe .
and when hindsight is your only insight , you know you 're in trouble .
it 's easy to figure out who had it right on intelligence issues a few years down the line , even easier to find the " i-told-you-so heroes " eager to tell their tales of cassandrian victimization .
and that 's really all state of war does .
it collects a pile of disconnected ( often single-sourced and anonymous ) anecdotes , and fleshes them out .
the more interesting the story , the more questionably it 's sourced , and the fuller its fleshed .
in the end , it 's a bloated yet vacuous work that discloses sensitive specifics in order to illustrate a few widely known and obvious generalities , those being :

intelligence gathering is n't perfect .
mistakes are often made .
present laws do not keep up with technology .
( just in case you did n't know that already )

if you 're hoping for an across the board bush slam , think twice .
there 's info on botched clinton-era operations as well ( one of which transferred nuclear weapons technology to one of our favorite mid-east regimes ) , but again , why ?
what 's worse , the specifics in the book have given terrorists valuable intelligence without giving anyone else anything usable ( unless cocktail party whining is a " use " ) .
in the wake of this book and the politically-motivated ny times story , the bad guys have already started altering how they do their communications .
great news for american civilians and military members alike .
this book might have a place 10-20 years down the line .
but as it stands , during an active shooting war , a valuable , effective , and completely legal intelligence gathering tool ( a tool clinton used with " 0 " congressional oversight ) is revealed and disabled so that james risen can buy a boat .
another triumph of american journalism !

i ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it .
it was terrible !
tanya holland is a beautiful black woman , but i feel has gone too far out of the way to create " innovative and different " recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food .
the price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook .
i collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others .
if you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent , your money would be better spent on " essence brings you great cooking " by jonell nash , " the ebony cookbook " by freida deknight or " the black family reunion cookbook " by the the national council of negro women .
if you are interested in healthier soul food try , " the new ebony cookbook " by charlotte lyons or " the family dinner quilt cookbook " by the national council of negro women .
if you are interested in diverse , cultural flavors , i would recommend vertamae grosvenor 's cookbooks or " iron pots and wooden spoons " by jessica b. harris .
i have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks .
they cover the gamut .
that is why i can give an honest opinion on tanya holland 's book .
i just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average african american can relate to .
one that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking .

i 've always been a big believer in " attack the message " ( if you do n't agree ) , do n't attack the messenger .
the reverse has been almost standard practice of the left when they ca n't refute the truth , facts and common sense of conservatives .
which is close to 100 % of the time .
so i have to be very careful not to copy the left when i write as a fifth generation kansan and having lived all of my life , thus far , in the same " upper-middle class " suburb mr. frank seems to so despise in his first and only book .
but his book was so filled with errors , personal opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events , people and general culture , as to make it a book of fiction ; not one of fact .
he stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them .
he relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he was n't born into a poor family of migrant laborers .
perhaps born as ms. condoleezza rice ?
she is certainly a good example of someone held down by evil conservatives and not permitted to excel in life ( not ) .
living in , and exposed to , the surroundings of his childhood , it appears to me his life 's goal was to become a professional victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth .
he 's , so far , at least succeeding in that !
being an accomplished loser .
what a goal !
his only " accomplishment " was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of the dailykos .
having written his fictional book of what life is not like in johnson county , kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of life 's losing lottery , he really has nothing else to say .
perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the left writing the same type of fiction over and over ( as he just did for the ny times ) .
he must be a very unhappy person .
it seems most liberals are .
how sad .
the only real obstacle they have in life is seen in their mirror each morning .
that 's it no matter how much they deny reality .
he seems like an intelligent young man who had everything going for him .
what a waste of talent .
now , he 's just another " victim " doing his best to convince everyone else they too should just give up as they ca n't win in life no matter how hard they try .
as i intimated , i 'm sure glad condoleezza rice ignored people like him !
i just wish people like him were fewer in number and that more ignored their delusional vision of reality .
checking in from kansas , he is a " one book wonder " .

i recently read this as part of a survey of childrens ' literature about the medieval period .
let me say first , that the dialogue is completely modernized , with not even a complex word to redeem it .
i know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect , but please , our children are more sophisticated than that .
adam is self-involved , careless , and annoyingly stupid .
despite it 's touted 320 pages , this could have been printed in 150 , and contained much the same material .
the only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of latin and old english ballads scattered throughout .
if you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times , with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability , have them read song of the gargoyle .
it 's also about a boy who loses his father , and has to search for him , in the company of a dog-like being , but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash .
the boy is also a minstrel , of sorts , but he has more likable qualities than adam , as well as more adventures in less pages .
the ending is a happy one , but it involves a twist , which is n't at all forseeable , as theat in adam of the road .
please , just skip this , i do n't care if it won a newberry award , and read song of the gargoyle , by zylpha keatly snider

well in my opinion , there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies , and some people have had some unusual experiences ( mostly disturbing , but some apparrently enlightening ) , but the question is , is it all as it seems ?
the fact of the matter is , various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us .
holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys ( this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events ) ; there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario ; advanced , drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour ; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now ( verichip ) .
i 'm not saying that other lifeforms do n't exist in the universe ( far from it ) , and perhaps there are a number of entities here on earth carrying out agendas , but this idea that there are little , menacing greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense collusion seems suspect .
it smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us .
historically , there 's been the barbarians , huns , mongols , pagans , jews , christians , vikings , black natives , cannabals , red natives , mexicans , germans , nazis , communists , now the arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on earth .
even president reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80 's .
the fact is that with known technology ( not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked ) , they could quite easily pull the hoax off .
even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and practiced ( albeit " underground " ) than most people can fathom .
what has become another fact is the major extent to which the ufo community has been infiltrated and compromised , of which strieber has been front and centre at various times .
my belief is that strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign , sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups .
in this book , his " hard-evidence " is flimsey and suspicious .
for example , why would n't super advanced aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue ( thus not showing up on any x-ray , mri , ct , etc ) ?
and design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body ?
surely , this would be child 's play for alien scientists ?
why no major discussion or mention of the human military , or nazi connection with abductions ?
there seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange " fragments " of memories that are slipping through various memory covers .
why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the greys ?
why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms ?
why are some speaking english , others german ?
why is there a connection with deep , underground bases and specifically antartica ?
these are things strieber never mentions , which i find curious .
my point is , things are happening , but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what , and strieber 's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas .

john r. barry ( another digital communications textbook author ) first introduced me to this text .
and mr. barry , as with many com .
theory persons i 've met since ( gtri in atlanta , ga ; mitre along around the boston area of ma ; northrup in el segundo , ca ; intersil in palm bay/melbourne , fl ) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs .
essentially , it 's their bible .
the only problem is that the values and beliefs in proakis , especially from an engineering perspective , are very third rate .
trying to use this text in a classroom situation , especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor , is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective .
john r. barry , for example , is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician ( he could n't be otherwise as a faculty member of georgia tech ) .
but as an engineer , john r. barry , as with the other followers of proakis , compares very unfavorably ( in fact , i do n't consider barry an engineer ; i consider him a phony that should be removed from the ece faculty of gatech ; the department 's economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct english/mathematics faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [ i.e. , vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance ( yes , i mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with jon voight [ angelina jolie 's dad ] and burt reynolds ) ] ...any place where truth/reality are n't so important ) .
there are far , far better communications engineers out there than john r. barry [ infinitely better to be precise ] .
and what makes these others better [ others meaning real engineers ; john r. barry being a make-believe " engineer " ] is not mathematical ability , memorized knowledge , or even rhetorical shrewdness , but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts ; something a follower of proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility .
in fact , the values and beliefs in the proakis text seem to promulgate not only intellectual abuse , but also a spiritual sort as well .
in a nation ( where steven pinker , who like proakis is of harvard fame , has noted ) that has around 75 % of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things , this kind of spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences .
though it may not be intentional , nevertheless , the values and beliefs of proakis 's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive .
these values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student 's own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs .
the result is almost always a broken-spirit .
from an economic perspective , this is bad .
very bad .
and it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it .
most of the " engineers " now being " developed " by the followers of proakis ( e.g. , john r. barry ) are very analogous to mid 20th century carribean medical school " doctors .
" they can say , write , and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes , i.e .
writing up invoices to insurance/government agencies .
these " engineers " like those " doctors " do n't and probably never will understand the essence of their professions , though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do .
when in fact , they are utterly clueless " professionals .

well , the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge .
his take on america 's military policies is ludicrous .
anyone who questions why the u.s. army is still in korea after 50 + years need only point to seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north , where he will discover north korea .
of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy .
conspiracy " theory " is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated ; it 's their sanctuary ; but for a scholar of johnson 's caliber to go there is incomprehensible .
unti you see what i saw .
the professional works that i read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing , all in scholarly language .
for the most part the popular books were not nominally about globalization at all , although globalization was the only thread holding the books together , and to each other .
brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ) ,the only possible reason for these immensely angry , nonsensical books is this : no one fully understands globalization .
no one .
even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast , too young to tame ; growing unpredictably every day like the blob .
they 're frustrated , these authors .
i ca n't blame them , but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the 've rounded up the usual suspect , america , as in why does america impose - dominate - ignore , etc .
the third world ?
silly question , really .
you 're at the top of the food chain , what do they expect you to do ?
when bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else .

this book is inexplicably influential , probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title .
barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis , instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on earth that he disagrees with .
barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world , while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness .
interestingly , barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance , using each other 's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior .
that is a fascinating thesis , which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating .
the first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists , of cultural trends that barber disdains , in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary .
it 's all tied together with attempts at " edgy " pop culture references , made-up terminology ( like the annoying " infotainment telesector " ) , and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping .
all is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term " mcworld , " which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless .
in his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses , barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior , or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days , or both .
in the second part of the book , barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots , in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states .
his umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term " jihad .
" note that this book was published back in 1995 , so that word was not as prevalent in western discourse as it is now , but barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout muslims and ardent anti-islamists .
when it comes to the specifics , many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in barber 's arguments , and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task .
you can agree or disagree with various critiques of barber 's contentions based on your own personal politics .
but everyone will probably conclude that in this book 's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis ( embodied in the book 's title ) , and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector .
overall , this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world .

in today 's world , various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism .
these forms of parochialism may be ethnic , " cultural , " religious , nationalistic , etc. , depending on where you look .
on one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups ; on the other hand , multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace .
example : the turks and the armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ( " jihad " is barber 's label for this ) ; yet they see the same pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local pepsi bottling plants ( " mcworld " is barber 's label for this ) .
that 's the book .
this might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious .
outside of that , it would take an observer from another planet to find this book 's insights novel or pointed .
if you 're new to planet earth , by all means pick up a copy .
it will catch you up on a few useful truisms .
as others have pointed out , the " terrorism 's challenge to democracy " subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11 , but does n't accurately reflect the book 's content .
" jihad " is deployed as a synecdoche in this book ; muslim extremism is just one of the book 's many examples of parochialism

this is a classic circle jerk book that consolidates a number of articles from educators and educational researchers who talk about the same thing , and cite each other or similar data and research .
the authors do write well , so i gave it two stars .
but it has under/overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system - dump more money into schools ; teachers are underpaid and overworked ; high stakes standardized testing is bad .
folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of jay p. greene 's " educational myths " to run a little de-tox on the stuff they read here

this was a comprehensive collection of statistics and war department strategy notes but it had no life .
it gave no feel for the soldier , sailor or marine on the ground .
it was all acronyms and big picture strategy .
if you are looking for something less academic and more readable try a different account of the battle .
since this was one of the most gruelling and bloody encounters of the war , the participants should get more ink .
here , the brass get all the attention

sure , i had fun reading this book .
but the amazon reviewer who termed it " highly speculative " is understating the case .
opinion , conjecture , hearsay , and speculation too often take the place of thorough , solid documentation .
and unlike many other amazon reviewers , i found mclellan 's tone off-putting .
she alternates between patronizing her subjects ( the very notion of calling them " my girls , " for instance ) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader .
is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant ?
you bet .
but is the topic of lesbianism in hollywood well-served here ?
i do n't think so

judging by the long reviews before me , it should be obvious that there is much to say about calvin 's theology .
this book does n't say too much .
for those familiar with his theology , do n't buy this book .
it will be a waste of your money .
for those who would like to know more about calvin 's theology , without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology , buy this .
if you want a good in depth coverage of calvin 's theology , buy the full version and enjoy

if you just got out of prison or maybe had a spell of amnesia or if your just hitting your 20th or 21st birthday then you may learn some stuff here .
but if you got yourself online to read this review then i doubt you will find this book much help .
there were a few helpful ehows for me in the book though .
for example i forgot exactly how to boil an egg .
and there it was in the book .
a typical type of ehow .
and this book is big and heavy .
with most info ridiculously simple i would say the size to useful ratio is not that desirable .
maybe this would make an ok high school graduation gift but other than that most people should avoid this book .
the ehow website is great though and its free ! .

in the possibility that steve berry could ever transcend his not-so great debut , the amber room .
romanov prophecy started in the right direction , third secret was ok , but i think he hit his * peak * right there .
i really want authors to get better--heck , i hope to write better papers as i go along in college .
but , steve berry , sorry .
and for all you people out there who do n't like it when people give negative reviews of a book you like , just hang on a second before you give me a big fat no vote .
first of all , even though this is fiction , the whole da vinci code genre purports to be based on fact .
berry always writes his note at the end to underscore this .
however , if you want the reader to accept your plot , please get some basic facts correct first .
the most annoying one for me , as , ahem , a french major , is the very dramatic chapter closer where they zip off to the " palais des popes .
" excuse .
me .
" popes " ?
just because the english word looks kind of like the french word " pape " ( for pope ) does n't mean you can flippantly swap them !
eek .
and , btw , this is a real place , so some editor somewhere should have noticed this .
shame on you , s.b .
's editors .
ok , i 'm not saying a novel must contain no anachronisms whatsoever ( it is fiction , after all ) , but really big , glaring mistakes of geography or history can not be tolerated .
the other main issue i have with this book is the vehement attack on jesus christ and the resurrection and the bible as a whole .
cotton malone , our hero , says that the bible contains hundreds ( i 'm paraphrasing ) glaring inconsistencies .
if i remember correctly , he says that one of the gospels ( he picks on matthew a lot ) does n't place bethlehem as the place of jesus ' birth .
that one does n't hold water--i checked matthew myself .
says so in ch .
2 .
i do n't mean to thump the metaphorical bible , but who is steve berry to question the authenticity of the world 's # 1 bestseller ever ?
that 's quite audacious ... some would even say blasphemous--but i tread on glass .
i really ca n't go into the terrible character development , or lack thereof , or the wussy knights templar .
yeah , they 're big and bad , but malone seems to bump them off with the greatest of ease .
some " knights of christ " they are .
well , having alienated most of you , i bid you farewell as i go in search of a more worthy book

jesus , talk about the little girl crying " wolf .
" when i picked up this book , i expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with .
what i got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption .
the book starts out promisingly , even if preston surrenders freely to flowery prose .
we 're given the account of charles monet , one of the first documented cases of the ebola virus .
from there on , preston gives a description of the virus , what it does , how it does it - the works .
then , he moves on to the human component , the cast of characters , so to speak , for the big story .
the big story is , alas , not so impressive .
it 's a case of an ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about , but nothing of the sort happens .
basically , people run around in bio-hazard gear , fret a lot , and monkeys die .
in between , preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the ebola virus , cases of people being infected , " crashing and bleeding out , " cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys , unless you 're a peta type .
the worst thing about the hot zone is just how self-indulgent preston is .
he starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book , which is a noble idea , but not when they do n't die at the end .
basically , he 's trying to make you care about these people , and all for naught .
and by the time that you 're supposed to be truly concerned , you actually want them to die , because you 're tired of hearing about him describe , in active detail , what they eat in the morning , what they do in the afternoon , and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night .
when you 're addressing a subject as fascinating as a level 4 virus , why are you spending time talking about nancy jaax 's hands and karate prowess ?
moreover , when you 've finally gotten to the monkeys , why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild ?
does anyone really care ?
i wish i could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis , but i ca n't .
preston 's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary ; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions , but he instead chose to " get into the minds " of his subjects .
and what a bore that became .
there were only two redeeming aspects of this book : one was the description of the african , human ebola victims , and the other was the description of the virus itself , although , again , both were sabotaged by preston 's inability to write .
if you want to know something about ebola , go get an idiot 's guide to dangerous diseases and epidemics .
if you 're pining for the namby-pambiness of the human element , read the hot zone .
personally , i like to avoid rereading the uncle tom 's cabins of scientific accounting

the author is certainly writing for a target audience.......as one other reviewer said , white , upper-middle-class , female would-be mystics .
i found the stories of life on the commune mind-numbing ( then again , i was born in berkeley in 1970 , so that hippie commune kumbayah stuff reminds me of eating carob when i was a kid ) and the rest of what i did manage to read alienating.......zzzzzzzzzzzz.......i am not saying this is a bad book at all , just that it 's focus was so narrow that it completely lost my interest .
the language was so fuzzy and woo-woo that it just irritated my gen x ( for lack of a better word ) postpunk sensibility .
it 's a shame , too , as i was really looking forward to this book and hoping it would assist me in reconciling my own struggle between feminism and spirituality .

this was a terrible disappointment .
more of a memoir than anything about book-collecting , it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was .
there seemed to be no context or fabric to the book .
there were , however , hundreds of references to obscure authors , actors , film-writers , magazines and books .
there were pages at a time where i was completely lost because i had no idea about whom the author was speaking , but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader .
baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in australia , thence to britain to the us and ending in france .
again , there is no context .
he would flip from a reference to the obscure artist , to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book .
if viewed as a book about collecting books , you will not learn much .
if viewed as a memoir , there was little that was interesting about the author 's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions .
there were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector , but they were too few and far between .
if you could not tell by now , i can not see much reason to read this book .
i think mr. baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest

sheppard 's attempt to capture the " american youth angst " failed miserably .
instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through .
i never developed any connection or understanding of the characters .
each chapter seemed to stumble into the next , with the end as predictable as the next expletive sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge .
you 'd do better saving your money , driving to the nearest mall , and find the kid in the anarchy t-shirt looking sullen , because it appears that is all sheppard did in this work .

if you are a christian , this book is n't for you .
it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must " ... forgive god " and that we must love god " ... even if he isnt perfect " .
kusher even has the will to say that " ...god would not be god... " without our love for him .
at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said " ...let us make man in our image " he was speking to animals and creation .
kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution .
since when was god in need of forgiveness ?
isnt it that " ... god so loved the world " and it wasnt us that loved god ?
i have no words in describing this book .
it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ .
all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person .
why do bad things happen to good people ?
wrong question .
there are no good people in the world in the first place .
" for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god... " the world is in sin .
the world does not have good people ! !
only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous .
i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book .
it hasnt helped 4 million people , but it lied to them .
kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question " why "

as a long time fan of nicholas sparks , i was a little disappointed in this book .
the potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more .
the entire book takes place in this little bed and breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters .
there just was n't enough going on in this book to keep my attention .
sparks 's writing is beautiful as usual , but the plot for this story just did n't impress me the way his other stuff did .
if you are looking for a great nicholas sparks read , try the rescue

it is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject .
the reviewers who have lamented the short , choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another , without benefit of full explanation or connection , are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book .
i had to read some paragraphs several times and even then did n't understand what i was reading .
it was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind , as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on .
the description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages , which incited one yawn after another .
the book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances .
for example , the narrative is littered with sentences like : " she made for the east exit... " okay , fine , but did she run , walk , crawl , hop , skip , jump , or fly to the east exit ?
i just do n't know what to picture there .
the word " made " says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen .
this type of problem occurs on every page of the book .
i have n't read anything else the author has written , so i hate to be so critical .
i wonder , however , why his editor did n't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions .
i felt as if i was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft .
i have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations .
this just is n't one of them .
compare " the circus fire " to " into thin air , " " heart of the sea , " " batavia 's graveyard , " or " ordeal by hunger " and you 'll understand what i mean

since i listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as tony roberts performance was so bad , it was impossible to follow the story line .
he read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did .
in addition to the slooooow reading , his characterization were completely over the top .
dino sounded like a moron and " billy bob " well like a texas moron .
and what about billy bob , that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story .

toward the end of how now shall we live , chuck colson states , regarding popular music and media , that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet .
however , he warns , a diet of junk food can be fatal .
good advice concerning pop culture-but even more applicable to this book .
yes , it contains a kernel of truth , but it ultimately is dangerous if not balanced by a heavy diet of other thinkers and theologians such as thomas merton , st. francis of assisi , ron sider , tony campolo , brian mclaren , brother lawrence , philip yancey , wendell berry-the list goes on .
it often is guilty of oversimplifying the ideological conflicts the modern church faces , drawing the lines down to " christians " against the " naturalists " or " humanists , " thus ignoring the wide range of threats that seek to destroy the church .
while there is truth in colson 's writing , i believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by comfortable middle-class american thought and militaristic nationalism , sprinkled with the politically correct amount of christian belief .
his faith seems to be overly academic , one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and other spiritual disciplines .
evangelism , it seems to colson , is comprised heavily of apologetics .
the secularists must be shown that they are wrong , he says .
yes , there is truth and there is time for debate , but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships .
you see , i used to fear evolutionists and the proverbial round table of " secular humanists " that many conservative evangelicals love to discuss .
but as i 've grown , i realize that threats to the church come more often from within than from secular culture , and they almost always have more to do with power and politics than the enlightenment or science .

i borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read .
it is the first barr book i have read .
i did not like it because of several reasons .
first of all , the vulgar language was too much .
one can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter .
second , it was so mundane for a mystery .
the writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in yellowstone national park .
someone needs to give me a book of barr 's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk .

" just enough " is more than enough : a turgid , pretentious , strident , and wholly unoriginal piece of work .
its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior , nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature .
at best , this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the harvard business review , but surely not enough material for 280 pages !

please take this to heart... .
i love mr. belushi 's acting , he 's funny and all...i have nothing against his career and respect him for making all the changes he did in his life.. .
but...i can not say this louder then this :
not all women are the same ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i was reading this , i knew what i was to expect...so i went in with some knowledge .
i love a real man , i love a real man ! !
i am not your a-typical woman and i will kill or die trying to remain myself .
when ever i see book after book or hear more and more about this .... .
i just fume because i will be the first to admit women 's lib destroyed womanhood !
but and i repeat but...not all women are for women 's lib and all the damage caused is not supported by all women .
i am destroyed by people like mr. belushi because they think i am one of the group called 'all women ' and am judged because i belong to this group .
his book is the most selfish book i have ever read and again , do not get me wrong about being a man , i support it and ca n't stand a man who ca n't be a man... .
for me , money is not status , a career is not status and marriage does not complete me !
if you fail at making the money you want , i 'll encourage you to lift your spirits and never tell you what job to do...if you do n't have the money to take me out or buy me anything , i do n't judge the quality of who you are , i will enjoy a night in front of the dvd player with you and i 'm happy !
i do n't ask you to call because i 'm checking up on you , i ask you to call and let me know you 're safe....i do n't snoop in your stuff because i 'm nosey , i respect your privacy because i trust you - give me reason to stand up and not take your crap and i will , but only after i shower you with unconditional love and acceptance because i give it to you , and if that still has n't reached you , all i can do is then stand up for myself where my man should be protecting me .
yes , chivalry is the key to this girls heart , but you better have a set to back that up too !
your friends are my friends and i love them because i love you and you love them...nothing more , but they sure do take by destroying us since they do n't have the 'us ' in their own lives.. .
i support and wish there were more real men out there...there are only two wants from this woman to her man 1-do n't cheat on me and lie to my face , i need that security ( pay attention , my security does not come from your paycheck , it comes from your arm wrapped around me , protecting me with your love ) and 2- it is your job to take care of us and when you ca n't , i am right there to get your back not to get in your way , not to diminish you , but to help you when you say you need my help .
that did not cost you your friends , did not cost a penny and it did not cost you your freedoms as a man .
i give freely , lovingly , unconditionally and always not because of the notches on your bedpost , not because it cost you a dime , not because you did it my way , not because you gave up one dang thing - i gave you every reason to want to give me your arm around me and your want to protect me .
two things is all i need to give you an entire lifetime of love , honor , respect and every ounce of my body to you...freely...got it ? ? ?
i am halfway through the book and realized that yeah , i love one of the biggest jerks out there because of who he 's become , i will love him til the day i die and will always and i mean always give him that love , respect as a man and honor him as my man....because 'i ' want to change me to be a better woman , not because he got whipped into what i wanted him to be !
not all women fit the bill of true wamonhood but i sure am dang proud of myself that i strive for it

it is difficult , nay , impossible , to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious , money worshipping parasites , and that is exactly what we have in this novel .
out of the blue a godfather appears , a deus ex machina , who offers an idealistic lawyer , clay carter , more wealth than he can imagine or use .
anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait , a very sharp , very large hook .
with apparent ease , this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble .
enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him , he immediately loses sight of reality .
what a hollow and useless individual he is , as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world .
whether or not there are such individuals ( enron ?
) is beside the point .
they may exist , but i for one am not eager to hear their life stories .
the atmosphere in which they live is boring , as are their conversations , their lack of values , their hobbies , their sex lives , and their comeuppances .
somehow , even in their fall , they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are .
having read most of mr. grisham 's other books , i expected better from him .

i like john grisham , but the king of torts was a slow-moving disappointment .
grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel , which is fine , but he ends up putting the message above the story .
grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs ' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits .
this provides grisham with an excuse to explain , in agonizing detail , how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees .
grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers , and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients .
in the end , none of this adds up to an engaging storyline .
it does n't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that grisham is obviously setting up for a fall .
since i did n't care for this character , i found the storyline of the king of torts to be largely uninvolving .
this novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone .
i personally dislike class action lawsuits , but i read novels for entertainment , not to validate my own political beliefs .
although this book was decently written , i just did n't find the story interesting enough to recommend .
for a better version of this story , i would suggest a civil action by jonathan harr .

owen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk .
he comes off as arrogant , showing little empathy towards debra 's problems earlier on in their marriage ( eating disorder , depression , social anxiety ) .
he writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble debra was in , but instead are very embarrassing to her .
he comes across as a husband with no compassion .
it 's ironic that he goes on and on about debra 's poor choices in boyfriends over the years , and how they were always so controlling of her....and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and debra did n't keep the house tidy...and he did n't approve of the way she dressed ! !
seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated .
he repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is , his gpa , jobs , earning potential , etc...but then admits that when they separated , he sticks debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off !
he says it was in her name , so she can have it !
owen shows how little a man he really is in this book .
debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid , and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart , she would n't have gone down the road she did .
i feel very sorry for debra after reading this book

mark twain called the book of mormon " chloroform in print " and he was n't kidding .
it is by far the most boring read i have encountered ( i could barely get through it ) .
i am a woman of faith - faith in god and faith in christ and i do n't know how anyone could believe this rubbish .
please , anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church .
ask some hard questions ( you will likely get a rehearsed answer , but it 's worth a shot ) .
joseph smith was accused ( and fined with a misdimeanor ) of being a " glass looker " - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the spanish .
he would use " magic stones " that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location .
so convenient that he later found " gold plates " and used what he called the " urim and thum " ( which , by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the high priests of israel in biblical times ) to translate these plates ( he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat ) .
there are so many myths that are told by members of the church " most men were so distraught at the thought of polygamy " , the age issue of joseph translating the book of mormon , joseph smith 's actual role in polygamy ( which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband... 11 of josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him , having never divorced the first husband - what 's up with that ? ? ? ) . .
etc.. and the list goes on and on.. .
i am not disputing that mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts , i think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that 's great !
just please do some homework first and do n't just rely on the " power of prayer " .
there is a reason that utah is the [ ... ] capital of the usa ( i 'm sure every one of those people " prayed " about that big business decision - it can often be mis-intrepreted ) .

while it is true that brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking .
i returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife .
i 'm very tender when it comes to wildlife , and while i know that death is a natural part of the life cycle , i am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures .
for anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos , then this is not the book for them .
otherwise , i would recommend it

i 've read every one of iris johansen 's " suspense " novels and have loved most of them .
the last couple though have been so painful to get through .
this one however , i do n't think i can even finish .
i read where someone called these characters " cardboard , " and i could n't agree more .
the female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist .
whereas in the eve duncan books and the wind dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters , it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class .
" now this should happen here , and this here , and this here and boom , climax , happily every after .
"

i hope that iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time .

mark rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in america .
most of his ideas are solid , but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word " interesting " to describe it .
did they actually read it ?
this book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different , yet equally boring ways .
i honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever .
this book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original , not to mention solid , ideas .
the nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument .
not only was the book dry , but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the us is a part of , and in particular , the role that immigration plays on poverty in the us .
he talks about the us and the people in it as if they were static , but we live in a very fluid world , growing more fluid everyday , and i feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument .

i read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men .
i am going to stick to books that have more balance or emphasize hot sex between men and women .
the other stuff just does n't do it for me .

you know , i hate to burst the bubble of devoted trotskyites across the globe , but trotsky was just as responsible for stalin 's rule as anyone .
for leon to blame stalin is the height of hypocrisy .
without lenin 's apparatus of social repression and trotsky 's apparatus of military dictatorship , stalin would never have been .
the russian revolution was never a win for workers .
it destroyed them , some 4 million at lenin 's hands , 30 million by stalin , and 65 million by mao tse-tung .
no policy or ideology that denies the soul can ever succeed .
and communism does just that .
by denying that which makes humans humans , it can bring only suffering

the self-improvement books how to win friends and influence people and talking the winner 's way are both way superior to this short book .
most of what you read is basically review if you 've ready other similar books .
and what 's present does n't pack enough substance or &quot ; how to&quot ; to make it really worth your time .
about half-way through the book , gabor started presenting fresh ideas .
the problem , however , is that it was half-way through the book .
not a bad read , but there 's so much better .
if you happen across it one day on the street , it wo n't do any harm to read it .
but i ca n't recommend paying money for something you already know , or can get for a better deal

the book is entertaining , however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent any time studying the ancient world to any degree...you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events , biblical texts , and blatantly stretched ( pun so intended ) the truth on so much .
i 'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong , but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol .
if you take away any claim of being a historical reference , this book is good .
it 's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does .
totally not serious , but a giggle to be had here and there .
some of which is at the author 's expense

when i first got diagnosed with add ( as an adult ) i believe the exact phrase " you mean i 'm not lazy , crazy or stupid ?
" went through my mind .
finally , there was an explanation .
so when i heard about a book by that name , certainly i had to check it out .
once i did though , i was sorely disappointed .
i have add , yes .
nevertheless , i 've still managed to get pretty far in life in spite of the " handycap " the authors of this book seem so eager to hide under .
it 's been a while since i read it , but i have the distinct recollection of finding some new example of a " you ca n't succeed in the world because you are 'disabled ' " mentality on every page .
you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that , you 've failed and you will continue to fail - just accept it .
excuse me ?
i do n't know about the authors of this book , but my add makes me creative and intuitive and perceptive and just generally a genuinely unique and awesome person ( egomania aside ) .
where is this addressed ?
where are the helpful hints for harnessing that kind of potential ?
if they 're in there , i sure did n't see them .
all i found were new little tricks for combatting the " affliction " with which i am ( oh so unfortunately ) beset .
using these tricks , i can hope against hope for some semblence of a " normal " life they say .
thanks but no thanks .
i 'm doing pretty well so far , and i refuse to feel like some sort of mental cripple .
if you , and the authors are happy considering yourself as something less than the rest of the world because of the way your mind works , feel free - this is the perfect book for you .
but you can count me out .

have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on ?
for me , that was this book .
if you like fantasy then you might like this , because that is the genre of this book .
it is about a jewish girl named hannah .
she goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door .
she opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream .
she now has a new name , chaya .
she now has to figure out what happened , and what she will do in this body .
it takes place in new rochelle .
it is old times .
it does n't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting .
she does n't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it .
i did n't like this book at all .
i thought it was really hard to follow .
you have to pay attention throughout the whole book .
you can never daydream or you wo n't know why they are calling her a new name .
this was definitely made for older adults , or people with a higher reading level .
if you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself , try this book .
i do n't recommend this book if you are younger , or just not that well of a reader .
this is for very and i mean very good and high level readers .
i would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book .
i do n't think this book was a page turner .
i wanted to put it down , instead of not wanting to put it down .
it never sparked my interest .
her being jewish , and the book being a fantasy , i could n't relate to anything that happened .
this book was hard to concentrate on .
if you look up for one second , you miss most of the story , so concentrate hard .
i could n't relate to anyone .
i am not jewish .
if you are jewish , you might actually understand this book better than i could .
i did n't like the genre .
it was all fake and totally unrealistic .
if you like that sort of stuff , then read this book , but i do n't like fantasy .
i did n't like how it was written .
it was too hard to concentrate on .
i had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name .
i never found any surprised in the story .
i could guess what would happen next .
it was predictable .
none of the chapters had cliffhangers .
if just was boring and that 's it .
i thought it was extremely boring .
i did n't understand anything and i would rather do my homework , than read that book .
my mind wandered a lot .
i had to read sections over and over again .
i never believed the plot one bit .
with the story being fantasy , everything is farfetched .
i think older people would enjoy this book , because they would be the only ones who could understand it .

i picked up this book at the airport as i was heading to japan .
while staying with my in laws in the country , there is no english language anything .
this is all i brought so i had to finish it .
but it was a struggle .
firstly i like complex thrillers , and i liked all the tom clancy jack ryan series .
technically excellent , if with totally one dimensional characters .
this book reminds me of the original star trek , where everyone but the captain is affected by the virus .
the hero is always right .
bell can write , his prose , i think is fine , but the scenarios are sometimes laughably implausible .
i also agree with another reviewer here that there is an unpleasant racist overtone in some of his depictions of some of the bad guys .
overall awful , just awful .

i will be leaving the rest of the bell collection on the shelf

i 'll be the first to admit that i 'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels .
it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it .
this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book .
it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle .
but the result is a less satisfying book .
it skims rather than digs deep

this book provides nothing new .
it is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck .
if you have 401k , duh , it does that automatically...anyway , boring .
it also says to save money , do n't use credit cards , pay yourself , blah , blah , blah .
oh yeh , if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz .
ok , it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks .
one idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account .
upon reading this , i decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2 % i 've been earning on my saving account .
and not realizing the latest craze started by ing , all the other banks offer an " online savings " account which offers 5 % compare to the dismal .2 % .
i immediately switched !
other than this part of the book , it was boring

the reviewer below who said " more heat than light " got it partly right .
this book is so badly written you have to wonder if the author 's other works were written by the same person .
not only is it sophomoric , it is gibberish .
had its author been unknown , she would surely have had to pay for the book 's publication .
incredibly bad , it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers

for someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science , stephen jay gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book .
gould rambles on and on , attacking giants of modern science like samuel morton and francis galton , and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own .
gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class .
gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct .
for anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science .
stephen jay gould is a paleontologist ; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him , and it would be best if he , as well as all other crypto-marxists who wish to blend science and politics , stay out of it

before i started reading " zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance , " the book had a lot going for it : stellar reviews on the cover , an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at walden books in pocatello .
unfortunately , despite these advantages , the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment .
do n't get me wrong , it was n't terrible , it just was n't very good .
i 'm not sure whether the book is a memoir , a novel or a philosophical treatise .
in " zen " robert pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son , chris in the 1970s .
but the story , i guess , is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology .
the only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page 17 :

" the buddha , the godhead , resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower .
"

that passage is good .
the rest of the book is depressing and confusing .
throughout the entire motorcycle trip , the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of " quality .
"

i 'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel , but if it was , it failed to produce character growth .
it 's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better .
the author 's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer .
whatever the book was supposed to be , it did n't impressed me .

</review_text>
<review_text>

i 'm at page 116 right now .
the writing is lovely , the specifics dense , and the sense of place rich .
if the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say , " i just ca n't go on with this story !
" i 'm going to throw the book at the wall .
also , so many embarrassing little holes .
if i were a librarian i would say , " so dracula 's checked out .
go to a bookstore .
every bookstore in the country has a copy .
" and if i were the cat , i would know i was a goner the second i appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph ( you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you 're going to fire it ) .
lastly , it seems like dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them .
unless " dracula " is related to our heroine--that would be good .
will read a bit more .

let me start by saying that i would have given this book zero stars if i could .
the reviews i 've read are all true .
this book is boring , extremely repetitive and a waste of time .
the only reason i finished it was because i paid for it .
i truly believe that danielle steel has lost her gift of writing .
she has not published a good book in a long time .
i also think that she 's lost her editor , because to me , a good editor would n't let books like this be printed .
this story pretty much follows stories she 's done before except it 's told from the guy 's point of view .
there 's the rich guy , charlie , who ca n't seem to find the " perfect " girl to marry .
he finds a flaw with every one he dates .
he lost his parents at a young age , his sister left school to raise him , and just before he graduated college , she died of a brain tumor .
so of course he 's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him .
then there 's rich adam , whose wife left him and took their two children with her .
it was a bitter divorce , so he has no desire to ever marry again .
he dates girls half his age and never stays with one long .
his parents blame him for the divorce .
every time he visits them , his mother let 's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family .
the last of the trio is gary , a struggling artist .
he has no desire to ever marry or date .
the three men spend the month of august each year on charlie 's yacht , partying and going on and on about how they do n't want commitments .
well of course , each one meets someone , they start to date , they argue , they break up , they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after .
same old story .
danielle steel should stop writing .
you ca n't tell me she does n't have enough money to live on .
i for one will not read any more of her books , even a paperback , and i wo n't even bother renting them from the library .
i wo n't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time .
there are better authors available and i 'm going to read them

this is the second nevada barr that i have read .
i picked it up on the strength of deep south , which i thought was really terrific .
it was frustrating that nearly all of what i liked about deep south was missing from flashback .
flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to anna pigeon 's own family .
the civil war story ( told through letters and dream-like sequences ) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story .
some may like the flavor that this element provides , but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that i most enjoy .
i really liked the crisp realism of deep south , and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre .
flashback , on the other hand , felt painfully contrived .
the plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and ( to my mind ) unnecessary .
if you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel , then you will probably be significantly less bothered than i was by flashback .
barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book .
judging from the reviews , not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines .
i will go ahead and pick up a third barr book , because i did like deep south so much .
it was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing , but hope that it can be redeemed with a third .

if an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery , you 'd think they 'd have a lo say about it , right ?
well , ford certainly expends plenty of words , but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories .
mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament , the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white , middle-aged , married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity .
story after story plods cautiously along , poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way , with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness .
adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male .
marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons , and yet ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it .
i have no idea what his personal background or situation is , but it 's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something .
if he was n't such a literary bigshot , there 's no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over , and is n't provocative , insightful , or even interesting .
ps .
if you were planning on the audio version , do n't .
ford is a terrible reader , sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment

...essentially you get what you pay for .
this book is certanly not representative of what i have come to expect from national geographic .
i had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book , but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best .
most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish .
in the past i 've found photographs by professionals like steve mccurry ( 'portraits ' ) visually arresting .
not so here .
at least it only cost me $ 20 oredering from amazon .
if i had been able to preview it beforehand , i would not have thought it worth even the discounted price

if hz 's sensationalist title gives you pause , you 're on to something .
the " story " preston narrates is , indeed , terrifying .
it is a story about disease , politics , epidemiology , history , geography.. .
so much could have been made of this story ( and so much has been , by far more capable writers ) .
preston , it seems , is only capable of going for the jugular .
hz shows no evidence of research ( it lacks even a trace of a bibliography ) , and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp , on the part of its author , of the history , epidemiology , or politics of ebola ( no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic ) .
from its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab , to its closing page 'death-defying ' romp through kitum cave ( how very brave of you , rp !
) , hz is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode .
if this book was not a thinly veiled hollywood screenplay , i 'll eat my proverbial hat .
even this might have been tolerable were preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer .
hz is all cliches and lazy reporting .
it is an embarassment

the official censes of the ottoman empire in the early 1900s showed well over five million christians living in the provinces of what are now modern turkey .
western specialists who helped the turks conduct their censes stated that the turks purposely undercounted the christians and overcounted the turks .
so , there were many more than just five million christians .
there are now approximately only a hundred thousand christians in modern turkey .
the question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today .
we know that over a million surviving greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between greece and turkey in 1923 .
again , what happened to the huge difference of 4-5 million people ?
to the 1.5 million massacred armenians , must be added three quarters to a million assyriac christians ( aramaic-speaking arab christians ) and as many as two million greeks ( almost 30 percent of the greek people ) .
the author does not touch on the large numbers of christians who were enslaved by turks or forced to convert to islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number greek-speaking " turks " around trebizon on the black sea .
it is not as if there is not vast contemporary accounts of neutral and western observers of this enormous genocide and ethnic cleansing of the original , pre-turkish populations of anatolia .
i can only conclude that the author had such an inborn bias in favor of turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the jewish holocaust of wwii .
avoiding this subject amounts to holocaust denial .
the christian genocide was the first great genocide of the 20th century and hitler 's model for the jewish genocide .
the massacre of the greek and armenian population of smyrna ( now izmir ) ranks with the rape of nanking in sheer horror and scale , but the author skips over it in a rush to avoid any detail of the crime or assign any blame except to the greeks and armenians by repeating the discredited canard that they set fire to their own city .
the author 's treatment of the christian genocide reminds me of the comments to me of a turkish officer at a nato conference which were to the effect that there had been no armenian genocide ( the turkish government official line ) but , in any case , that they had deserved it .
the author seems to have taken her treatment of the subject from the turkish government as well

" karl marx , years ago , gave a description of why this might be happening .
he followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value : an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make .
"

no it 's not ! ! !
an object 's worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers .
to imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make , which would mean that we should subsidize the military-industrial complex , since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things .
" petty-bourgeois ' owners , i.e .
the mom-and-pop stores and small business in general , of which my grandpa , a dentist , was a part of , are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail .
"

this is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government .
all regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out .
there 's a reason why the owner 's of wal-mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $ 8 , as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt , lay off employees , and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with wal-mart .
another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to wal-mart ( wal-mart collects millions in subsidies due to marx 's labor theory of value once again ) and of the use of emminent domain abuse ( which can be justified on the grounds of the " greater good " as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores ) .
" but no theory is ever flawless , and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and " reality .
" there is no reason to believe that heavy social hierarchy and class division is a necessary evil ; workers can manage their lives just fine through cooperatives .
"

sure there is .
human beings are inherently unequal , differing in many skills , abilities , ambition , the choices that they make in life , how they apply their time , etc .
etc .
of course , there is is n't any reason that individuals ca n't create wealth nonetheless , creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some good or service itself .
and cooperatives need to be voluntary first .
nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth .
there needs to be some division of labor , trade and commerce , etc .
or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the real law of the jungle to survive .
this ca n't happen if everything is collectively owned .
" since workers are the sole producers of goods from scratch to end "

no !
entreprenuers , innovators , etc .
provide much of the creativity , design , direction for the purchase and use of capital goods , negotiation of deals , evaluation of threats , problems , and consumer requests , and other such things .
it was n't the workers at microsoft who created cheap desktop computers , it was bill gates , the workers are merely a form of mass-production who help out , but ultimately mass produce a good or service in exchange for privately owned wages , caused by supply and demand .

pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers , whose very existence and relevance is due to that king .
what you will get from that kind of writing ?
noonan was a speechwriter reagan administration .
sound familiar ?
noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings .
probably she does not care .
americans are lucky that they never had any king .
noonan fails to provide any inside information how reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - aids , iran-contra , welfare , deficits , funding mujahideens , cozy relationship with saddam .
instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler , happy citizens... " happily lived ever after " .
basically , this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer .
her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers do n't know already .
this is a writing isolated from the reality of 80 's ( which is nothing new in human civilizations ) .
secondly , she fails to understand that reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working americans .
but she gives all the credits to reagan , except all the negative things , like iran-contra .
in the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings , characters of kings and the writings about them

my grandmother and my mother have read danielle steele for years , but i must admit i 'd never picked one up .
i was always more for historical romances .
but i wanted something different , had heard good things about her , so while at the library , decided to give her a try .
i have to say i 'm extremely disappointed .
granted , i 'm a fellow writer ( a very picky reader by nature ) , and an unpublished one to boot , but the writing could 've been better in my opinion .
the first five pages are all backstory of paris 's marriage ( no action , no excitement , told very " history lesson-ish " ) and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between paris and her husband ( the inciting incident in the first chapter ) left me wondering , " so what ? " .
twenty five pages in , i could care less about these people .
i honestly expected more from a bestselling author .

i wonder if im reading the same book the others are reading .
i 'm on page 101 right now and it took me about 4 days to get this far .
( i 've gone through 3 clique books in a day , so it 's not like i 'm a slow reader ) the book is just so boring .
its like ive read all of this cr @ p before !
so far sam had a graduation party at her dad 's yacht , we hear about 2 new characters from a rival school who happen to be enemies of sam and her group and conveniently enough the two schools do something together , i forget what but it looks like it will be the opportunity for sam to get her revenge for getting poop smeared on her white jeans a few years back ( eye-roll ) .
anna is incapable of taking care of herself at a time of crisis ( her car gets rear ended by some cliche white trash woman ) so her dad 's 'dont judge a book by the cover cliche ' tatooed but hot new intern comes to rescue her , omg romance !
( another eye roll ) ben is being a troll my guess is hes cheating on her , but seriously reading that chapter where they go on this really uncomfortable date just made me want to scream at the book !
it was so annoying .
the only thing keeping me reading right now is the cammie storyline , i want her to confront her dad and find out what happened to her mom .
right now im giving the book 2 stars , after i finish the book ( if i ever do ) ill come back and edit this .
if anyone wants to take me out of my misery and tell me what happened to cammies mom , be my guest !
lol

* * * edit * * * it got a lot better after page 101 , the sam plot got developed ( a bit overdone , tacky and stalkerish , i mean a life size cut out ?
a 100 cell phones ?
come on , what a waste of money .
she could have donated all that $ $ $ to some charity in peru and impressed her guy a lot more .
the cammie story is getting juicier , and parker may have a bona fide crush on sam .
i still think ben is a creep .
well i guess i wont spoiler everything lol .
i 'm still not done yet .
ill continue this after i finish .
* * * final edit * * * after a good middle , the book took a nosedive .
the story of cammie 's mother was horribly disappointing .
i officially hate ben now and im getting more and more sick of anna for even being into him .
what kind of guy tries to make a girl feel weird and uptight for thinking that sex between two people should be special ? ? ?
that just really turned me off .
the girl who wins a contest by wearing nothing but body paint to the party ? ?
okay , this is a book that 12 year olds read , did we seriously need to hear that ?
the best way to get liked is to get naked ?
sigh... the two stars rating stands .
sorry

after having read and loved howard pyle 's 1968 classic press
edition of " the merry adventures of robin hood " i was quite
disappointed with " the story of king arthur and his knights " .
whereas pyle brilliantly brought his characters to life in " robin
hood " , the characters of " king arthur " seem flat and lifeless
by comparison .
the king arthur stories read like little more
than a description of events ; one does n't really get a feeling
of being there while things are happening as in " robin hood .
"
the dialogue seems much more realistic in " robin hood " , but i
think there 's more to it .
the writing style in " king arthur "
i 'd characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming , poetic style of writing in " robin hood .

these are revised remarks since my comments about " prediabetes " and " stop diabetes " being the same book .
i got them both and felt somewhat duped .
gretchen did contact me to explain the prediabetes is a second edition of stop diabetes .
i wish it said that on the cover .
the book ( s ) info about stopping the progression of diabetes is great , so i do recommend either of these books .
it is well written in a style that 's easy to understand .
just do n't get both books ; they 're essentially identical

this book is so densely packed with miniscule details and examples that the information 's significance becomes blurred , if not obsolete .
the authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject , but they fail to analyze the information they present .
the reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included .
the authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective .
the only minutely important information is presented in the topic sentences of each paragraph , and the book can be reasonably well understood just by reading the introductory sentences .
while this book could be a treasure house for someone researching the relationship between manors and their respective villages , the average reader 's attention is never captured .
students , beware !
before embarking on an excruciatingly dull explaination of medieval village life , reconsider your other options of reading material .
( one option is another book by these authors that has gotten better reveiws .

i found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the sham ( self-help actualization motivational ) movement is , and maybe even on why it is , but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it .
i thought , sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain-washing in such a humorous way , that the author might have a sense of humor herself and i 'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well .
i would read a page or a paragraph or two , close the book , and nod off .
this is such a fascinating area , it could be the basis for a really fascinating book , but " self-help , inc... " left me feeling i needed to go to a self-help group to deal with the density of the verbage .
it would not appeal most to the people most in need of reading it - the victims of sham

this play explores the same old turf as " death of a salesman " , but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development .
eddie is no willy loman , though , and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central , driving force like willy .
parts of the play seem borrowed from tennessee williams , and they do n't seem to work in this context .
there is some business about the romance of the old world italy versus the new world of opportunity on the docks of new york , and it is the only topic that is at all explored well , if still unsatisfactorily .
eddie 's dreams are represented in his pretty niece , catherine ; and unlike willy loman 's uncle , she is still an attainable dream .
that makes eddie 's life seem all the more petty , in comparison to willy 's : he longs wearily not after what he could have had , but after what he can never have , as he is already married .
the death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced , tacked on ending , and alfieri 's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick .
there are better plays by miller , and many better plays by others

before purchasing made in detroit i read the reader reviews .
the reviews were so mixed that i decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead .
as it turns out i made the best decision .
all i can say is ` thank you fellow reviewers ' ; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price .
my statement has nothing to do with the author 's writing skills , he is a skilled writer .
it has everything to do with his lack of insight .
that paul clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary .
i read the book , waiting for paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them .
but after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one .
blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make paul 's life hard .
women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice .
he finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book .
if you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings .
if you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage .
as i read this book i felt sadness , a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed .
( there are white folks who actually still think like this .
) my hope is that the light comes on for paul , he is still young .
if it does maybe he will share his insights with us .

after reading the first book * ( which was catastropha ) and reading the second which was really good , i thought that the series is taking off , i was mistaken , the third book is slow , and boring , you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that series

nothing much is happening , and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas , the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find ( and better written as well ) in dragon lance series , or other adventure books , also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books ,

reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book , which some say is very boring
i guess this is where the adventure end for me. .

since god is infinite goodness , we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion .
when we are comfortable , we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need god .
since god knows that he is the only thing that we really need , he inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact .
so pain is god 's megaphone .
if some people , such as the jews , try to love god without going through christ , it is not yet god - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain .
hence poor god is forced to keep screeching at them through his megaphone .
but even people who try their hardest to love the true god , such as job , or c. s. lewis for that matter , can not adore god as much as he wants to be adored , so he uses pain over and over again to " plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls .
"

where does this notion of an infinitely good god come from ?
given mankind 's painful existence , " an inference from the course of events in this world to the goodness and wisdom of the creator would be preposterous .
" god had to reveal himself to mankind by revelation ; thus it is in the likes of abraham and moses , who identified god as righteous , that all peoples are blessed .
lewis informs us that god expostulated with his own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - " what iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me ?
" one has to wonder if lewis has ever actually read the bible .
can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that abraham and moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters ?
i have never understood why , or how , i am supposed to pretend that this is not true .
of course , god is wiser than me , so if i could only see it from god 's viewpoint , i would see that the butchery of whole populations , including babies and animals , was actually an act of love .
in mere christianity lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as " damn nonsense .
" undoubtedly , we get the impression of a just and loving god through the teachings of christ , but the conviction that god is infinite goodness , omniscience , and omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation ; it was developed by medieval christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that lewis , rather inexplicably , deems impossible .
lewis 's insistence that people have free will needs to be examined .
even as he describes it , since we are born in sin , we can not use free will to avoid sin , and most people are blind to their sin .
hence , it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception .
the evidence suggests that incessant pain , especially when inflicted upon children , destroys this ability .
abused children typically grow up to be abusers .
in my own case , i adamantly insist it was the drug , marijuana , which first gave me introspective ability , at the age of 23 .
prior to that moment , god knows that i had no free will .
free will is not a realized trait that we are born with , but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop .
in most people it remains largely dormant .
since free will is dependent on self-knowledge , the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability .
dogmatic adherence can only hinder this .
lewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution .
unfortunately , it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by satan before man 's appearance on earth .
somehow , the perfectly good " paradisal man " descended from animals already corrupted by satan .
lewis can be abominably silly sometimes .
lewis is given to disjunctive , either/or , logic .
either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose , or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a revelation .
i would once have scoffed at this , but a numinous vision of christ was the major turning point of my life .
the problem is that this revelation was not at all consistent with mere christianity .
according to lewis , the purpose of pain is to break our will , since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from god .
i had only recently come to realize that i had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug .
i experienced christ in the very moment that i was cursing christ for demanding that i beg forgiveness for that which he was responsible .
albeit , at the time i was an atheist , and was only cursing at what i had been taught about christ .
i experienced christ as the core of my being , not as an entity completely separate from myself , and as an awakening of will , not a surrender .
lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with god , rather than a creature of god , is satan 's ultimate deception .
but i have also experienced satan within myself .
if christ were not the core of my being , i would never have survived satan .
i know the difference .
i do not acknowledge that christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of god must be .
i am a scientist by training , not given to superstitious credulity , however much like it what i have written above must sound .
in my attempt to make sense of my experience of christ and satan battling within my mind , i have come up with the following myth : it is , at least , not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence .
this consciousness would first be in a primordial state , probably in some way responsible for evolution , though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control .
there could be no distinction between good and evil ; in fact the terms could have no meaning , until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness .
as self-awareness developed , so did awareness of pain and terror , and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain .
the human mind , as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and , for whatever reason , tends to personify them as god and satan , or their various cultural equivalents .
what makes the christian god so detestable is his complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything .
satan can therefore be described as " god 's self-ignorance .
" buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter , hence there insistence that good and evil are identical .
c. s. lewis tells us that " it is not god 's purpose that we should go back into that old identity .
" i think i agree with him on this point .
mankind 's goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are .

this is truly a disappointing book .
it starts incredibly slowly and i found it very hard to become interested in the plot .
another disappointment is koontz 's recycling of elements from other novels : ( 1 ) plucky , highly intelligent disabled girl ( the young female protagonist in " the hideaway " had almost identical deformities and personality ) , ( 2 ) devoted , super-powered canine companions , ( 3 ) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out rvs , and ( 4 ) evil bioethicists .
the leilani character is patently ridiculous .
she conveniently has a genius iq , but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable .
i found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot .
koontz clearly has trouble writing for children , and this book is no exception .
almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/mr or genius wunderkinds ; the latter , however , does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults .
dean heaps the hardships on poor leilani , with all the subtlety of an episode of walker , texas ranger .
in case you miss the anvils , you are supposed to really , really like her and fear for her safety .
i do n't know how or where dean koontz learned about bioethics , but he has a terribly misguided view of <review_text>

i was there , as were several of my fellow sitka fire department emt 's and state troopers from the sitka academy .
the 6 of us , along with two parajumpers from the canadian armed services were flown through the typhoon winds , on a helicopter , out to the williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers - literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed .
we knew there was a doctor onboard , from anchorage , but we literally never met or saw him - i 'm sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up - but that is where he stayed .
the real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend .
but i was disappointed to see that mr. jeffers failed to fully research this book - the role the sitka rescue teams played ( both on the williamsburgh and trying to assess/fight the fire on the prinsendam ) was totally overlooked - despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story - which was the human side & had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event .
i was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out , was very sad .
at least we all have our commendations from both the coast guard commendant and the canadian armed services - they knew we were there !
too bad mr. jeffers did n't due diligence .

tropic of cancer by henry miller .
not recommended .
in his 1960 introduction to tropic of cancer , karl shapiro said , " i call henry miller the greatest living author because i think he is , " " .
.
.
as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age , " and " .
.
.
he [ orwell ] predicts that miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future .
this has not happened yet , but i agree that it must .
" shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay , and nothing about tropic of cancer supports them , either .
tropic of cancer consists of 318 pages recounting miller 's experience as an american expatriate in paris and expounding his personal philosophy , often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical .
miller 's stories about his friends are tedious , pointless , and catty ; like miller , they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers , as though believing is being .
miller writes , " a year ago , six months ago , i thought i was an artist .
i no longer think about it , i am " --which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances .
when they are not creating , or talking about philosophy or creating , miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women ( and disease ) .
they rarely use a neutral term such as " woman " when there are so many obscene , demeaning words with which to objectify the gender .
the women that miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid , drunken , irrational , loose , sly , deceptive , and good primarily for one function , which miller turns into a squalid , cold , joyless act .
in spite of all the vice and the " living , " no one seems to be having fun , and some characters , notably fillmore , find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life .
miller expresses contempt for the machine , the industrial age , and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from fillmore 's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket .
often hungry , miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him .
when he describes his indian friend kepi as " .

a scrounger , a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot , " he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money , accommodations , food , and wine .
miller 's logic about the working world is facile ; he writes , " if you want bread , you 've got to get in harness , get in lockstep .
" on the surface , this is true , but it never seems to occur to him that , if you want bread , someone must cultivate , raise , and harvest the wheat and produce the other components ; someone must transform these components into bread ; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes .
in other words , if most people were n't in " lock step , " miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread , joining the world in harness .
he makes his choice clear , then whines about it .
he may despise those who support him , whether they are friends or workers , but that is perhaps because he , a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself , needs the very people he denigrates ( including " the grocer , the baker , the shoemaker , the butcher , etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers " ) , a reliance which he resents .
he hates the machine and the machine mind , but offers no alternatives .
seemingly incapable of sincere feeling , miller finds human emotion amusing .
when a friend says , " a boy can break your heart .
.
.
he 's so damned beautiful !
and so cruel !
" miller writes , " we had to laugh at this .
it sounded preposterous .
but collins was in earnest .
" when an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies , he writes , " at any rate , he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival , a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good .
"

shapiro claims that miller is a poet , but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense .
speaking of buildings and statues , miller says , " .
.
.
they must be saturated with my anguish , " the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges .
he describes artists such as himself as the " inhuman ones .
" " i am inhuman !
i say it with a mad , hallucinated grin , and i will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles .
behind my words are all those grinning , leering , skulking skulls , some dead and grinning a long time , some grinning as if they had lockjaw , some grinning with the grimace of a grin , the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on .
" whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared , rambling on for pages , i found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes , disease , friends , and hunger .
tropic of cancer is perhaps the worst book i have ever read ( and i did promise myself that i would read tropic of capricorn ) .
shapiro says , " there are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [ emancipated from what ?
--dls ] , these clowns and clairvoyants , celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of america .
" if miller , with his whining , his criticism , his holier-than-everyone attitude , his " art , " his two-dimensional view of people , and his obsession with excrement , is the " greatest " of these souls , may i never meet the least .
note : if there were a 0 stars option , tropic of cancer would have earned it

this book was a complete waste .
it was boring to read and hard to follow .
i finished the book just see how it ended and hoping to clear up the confusion .
i never should have read past the first chapter .
read pop goes the weasle , or lake house by patterson .
just not this book .
it is hard to believe it is written by the same author

have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you would n't feel bad ?
have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him ?
in this story , the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he 's still a " good guy " because " good guys " do n't do bad things .
dizzing logic , huh ?
throughout the novel , you review his senior year of high school with him .
it starts out with the story of how he got the nickname " killer " to why it 's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue .
the flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he did n't rape her .
he wo n't let her leave the room until she believes it .
the ending is less than satisfactory for me .
i would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice

jesus , talk about the little girl crying " wolf .
" when i picked up this book , i expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with .
what i got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption .
the book starts out promisingly , even if preston surrenders freely to flowery prose .
we 're given the account of charles monet , one of the first documented cases of the ebola virus .
from there on , preston gives a description of the virus , what it does , how it does it - the works .
then , he moves on to the human component , the cast of characters , so to speak , for the big story .
the big story is , alas , not so impressive .
it 's a case of an ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about , but nothing of the sort happens .
basically , people run around in bio-hazard gear , fret a lot , and monkeys die .
in between , preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the ebola virus , cases of people being infected , " crashing and bleeding out , " cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys , unless you 're a peta type .
the worst thing about the hot zone is just how self-indulgent preston is .
he starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book , which is a noble idea , but not when they do n't die at the end .
basically , he 's trying to make you care about these people , and all for naught .
and by the time that you 're supposed to be truly concerned , you actually want them to die , because you 're tired of hearing about him describe , in active detail , what they eat in the morning , what they do in the afternoon , and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night .
when you 're addressing a subject as fascinating as a level 4 virus , why are you spending time talking about nancy jaax 's hands and karate prowess ?
moreover , when you 've finally gotten to the monkeys , why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild ?
does anyone really care ?
i wish i could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis , but i ca n't .
preston 's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary ; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions , but he instead chose to " get into the minds " of his subjects .
and what a bore that became .
there were only two redeeming aspects of this book : one was the description of the african , human ebola victims , and the other was the description of the virus itself , although , again , both were sabotaged by preston 's inability to write .
if you want to know something about ebola , go get an idiot 's guide to dangerous diseases and epidemics .
if you 're pining for the namby-pambiness of the human element , read the hot zone .
personally , i like to avoid rereading the uncle tom 's cabins of scientific accounting

this book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional .
this is absolutely not the case .

as a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler , this book was a big disappointment ! ! !
i bought this book after reading the reviews and wish i had n't paid more than $ 1 for it .
while the title " the unprocessed child " accurately describes laurie 's upbringing , this book should n't be grouped with other unschooling literature .
the author , while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter , reminds me of the mother in " love you forever " who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son 's room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy .
the fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with laurie pretty much says it all .
the mother clearly has her own issues that i hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she 's not spending 24/7 with her only child .
we have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and i feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them .
if you want to read a good book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter , i would recommend " homeschooling our children , unschooling ourselves " .
those authors offer more balance and eloquence than ms. fitzenreiter .

this was my first reading of jamaica kincaid .
she has a short , concise style , which made me often feel like i was reading poetry .
however , i felt that it also had some downsides , like stifling character growth .
in lucy , the title character comes to america to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters .
lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother , who for some reason she hates .
i wish we knew a bit more about lucy , like why she hated her homeland so much .
it was an alright quick read , but had it been longer , i doubted it would have held my attention

hmmm .
i 'm struggling to give agatha christie such a low rating .
she wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into .
not quick reads , but very methodical with lots of character development .
i do n't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters , but i always do it knowing that i will be rewarded with a great ending .
christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the &quot ; who , where and why&quot ; were finally revealed in the end .
i was shocked again at the end of this book - not because i did n't know who the killer was , but actually because i already knew who and how .
i tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious .
very disappointing .
christie books i would recommend instead - abc murders , and then there were none and murder of roger ackroyd

dr. northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies , stages of life and medical procedures .
however , i was appalled by her bias against western cultural heritage and christianity .
her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced , with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women .
as a catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded , compassionate religious sisters , i felt offended by her slur against nuns .
i am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing , but i would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research .

ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up .
i first bought the book , 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on , so i bought the audiobook ( 5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on ) .
now im stephen kings no1 fan and have loved the majority of his work , the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest .
so naturally i thought this would be the same .
the book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross , not a patch on previous work .
i forced myself through the book expecting more , and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror , excitment etc , do yourself a favour , get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book .
this book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore

i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001 , then it was a mere idea .
from that time on , until august 20th 2002 , i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time .
i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title : " let freedom ring " with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover , patriot that he is , but also a flag .
i loved it , could n't be more happy .
well , the day of the book 's release , i took a day off work ( i 've never missed a day of work before in my life ) , and rushed to get this book .
it looked better than i ever imagined .
with the flag on the cover and the title of " let freedom ring , " i thought , finally , technology has caught up to our patriotism .
i expected a book filled with flags , flags with sound effects .
maybe some firework sound effects .
boy was i wrong .
i opened the book only to the colors black and white .
no red .
no blue .
no stars and stripes .
i quickly turned the pages , looking , searching for flags .
i found none , no sound effects either , no fireworks .
at that point , i went into a 4 year long depression .
i nearly committed suicide at several points .
it 's only now that i can bring myself to review this man 's book , patriot that he is .
i say this so you know what you 're getting yourself into .
there are no flags , no stars and stripes , no fireworks , no sound effects .
i have since recovered , but only because of old stars and stripes .
i went back to teaching last year , not fully recovered , and my colleagues , knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes , suggested i have my class do a research project : find the most patriotic book ever made .
the methodoloy was simple : a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high , a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest .
we found some very good books and they did cheer me up .
the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called " president jesus : how jesus wrote the constitution , freed the slaves , and won world war ii .
" its published by a small church in texas .
i was very proud of my students for finding it .
it has brought countless joy to my life .
along with the book , made entirely out of a flag , with flag pictures , and written in blue and red ink , you get a giant flag .
i 'm not sure of the dimensions , but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck .
i 've draped it over my house and it covers it completely .
people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house .
now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time , smiling .

time was when the words betty crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks , although the books ' recipes , for better or for worse , were always a product of their times .
the very first " betty crocker picture cook book " was published in 1950 ( still available ) , revolutionized how cookbooks were produced , and was an enormous best-seller .
the recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company 's kitchens and in homes across america .
this was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages .
this gradually changed as betty and her books became more and more of a shill for general mills ' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company 's bottom line , but to the detriment of good cooking .
the two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps , although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes .
if you have one of these books , treasure and keep it ; you 'll never see their likes again .
the current 10th edition looks good but , like the past several editions , the number of recipes has been drastically reduced .
gone are the many variations , which are especially missed in baked goods .
it was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from .
now way too many recipes are of the " dump and stir " method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results .
also gone is the very friendly , assuring , conversationial voice of yesteryear .
yes , there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles , but they are mostly stripped-down versions .
it 's obvious that the folks at betty crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and ca n't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes , which begs the question of why general mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore .
the " better homes and gardens new cookbook " is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose , everyday guide .
it has a better layout , the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality , and there are more recipes and variations than betty crocker 's had in some time .
even better , if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family , i highly recommend the cookbooks of cooks ' illustrated/america 's test kitchen .
their comparable , general-purpose cookbook is called " the america 's test kitchen family cookbook .
" the recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times , if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them .
it 's a shame that betty crocker has abdicated her throne and good name , but there 's even better stuff out there now .
go for it !

the cover of this book declares that you 'll learn " ten simple truths that lead to an amazing life .
" if your idea of an amazing life can be distilled to " eat , drink , and be merry , " then perhaps you 'll see value in the sophomoric platitudes that abound in this book .
alfred e. neuman , of mad magazine , with his declaration of " what , me ?
worry ?
" provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by ms. laroche .
if you 're looking for some deeper meaning to life , to success , to accomplishment , you 'd be much better served by reading napoleon hill , anthony robbins , dr .

i was not a huge fan of the first book , but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book .
this may not be the case here .
while it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first , it is has it 's moments of unbeleiveablity .
how can dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him , and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him ?
the only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister , and i kind of think it might be only a matter of time .
i also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission .
are they going to introduce a new character to be " on to him " every book ?
this is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages .

i am agreeing to the comment of " e for effort " on this book .
this book describes the author 's attemps to improve his condition and how he suceeded .
but he admits in his book that he is not sure which ones actually worked .
plus , the author also takes diabetes medications , along with other medicines and supplements .
my main concern is what worked for him probably wo n't work for someone reading this book .
this book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do .
he made so many changes on the medications and supplements , it is hard to say what worked .
one can find the general imformation presented in this book on " diet " , " exercise " and " stress management " ( relating to clog arteries & heart diseases ) through the internet .
i did n't gain any new information by reading this book .
the printing of this book is also done in a very strange way .
the text is printed at the center , occupying only the center area with a lot of spaces around , so about half of the page is blank .

there is no doubt in my mind that josh harris is a good person , who sincerely wants to help people , particularly young christian women , who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene .
however , he does n't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular .
either he 's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant : inexcusable in either case , considering how influential this book has become .
is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage ?
no .
for the vast majority of singles , the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable .
few couples have actually gotten together this way .
the real reason why this book , with its overwhelmingly female readership , has sold so well comes down to one main reason : there is a severe shortage of single christian men , as documented in campuslifecollegeguide.com male/female ratios , and the barna research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the millions .
christianity today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that " rises to the top " for christian singles .
because christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from " god 's plan " for their lives , many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math , but certainly feel the lack of male attention .
unfortunately , this often gets boiled down to some kind of " passive christian guy thing " , but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women : which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage , whether it 's new york city , post-war russia or your local mega-church .
it 's not so much a lack of male leadership , but a lack of males .
and so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single christian men , who they greatly outnumber .
since reading christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel , many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice , the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference .
which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill , fuelling a christian singleness industry with its own slogan " the gift of singleness " that refuses to tell them the truth about the christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness !
of course , their lack of contentment ( an innate response that tells you that things do n't add up ) is something they are told to repent , ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship .
but as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that 's the result of the christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings , there 'll always be a market for christian self-help books like this one .
pure genius !
what 's more , there are " unintended consequences " that can go along with harris ' model for " courtship " that he does n't really address :

1 ) because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy 's intention to marry the woman , it makes asking a woman to do anything a big deal to him .
this can have several sub-consequences :
( a ) it creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk ( getting turned down for a date is bad enough , but imagine having your " potential marriage proposal " crash and burn !
) ( b ) it fosters prolonged crushes , as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is " the one " , he might not ever do it ( c ) ironically , it can boost up the guy 's expectations in terms of a woman 's looks .
because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads ( that yes , this is the kind of woman i want to marry ) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who do n't look like whatever their " wife prototype " might be .
guys who date and do n't make a big deal of " a date " are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways ( in " how to get a date worth keeping " , henry cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses were n't really " their type " when they first met ) .
2 ) it keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides .
serial dating ( as practiced in latin american countries , where a guy will ask out tons of women , get turned down by most of them until he has a " short-list " ) teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex .
you ask your way down your " ladder of options " until you find your equal ( likewise for women , in terms of dealing with the facts about who 's asking and who 's not ) .
with courtship , a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years .
the idea that it 's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is false .
you 're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend ( a real human being with chunky thighs and all ) than with the evangelical angelica jolie/brad pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence !
3 ) it reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex .
it reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in christian singles circles .
4 ) it 's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal ( which is essentially what courtship is ) on her without any prior notice that the guy ( who 's had a head start on working out his feelings ) is romantically interested .
most christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them , let alone entertain the thought of marriage .
5 ) it also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle , who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like .
kind of like , " he 's a nice , sincere , christian guy and he would n't be spending this kind of time with me if he did n't think of me as marriage material , right ?
" ...not always so .
if we are to stand back and take a look at it , the whole courtship redux really has n't gotten off the ground : it works for too few people at this time .
maybe the world has changed too much , or perhaps there are other issues today 's christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first : such as the confusion about " the gift of singleness " and the shortage of men .
i would recommend debbie maken 's getting serious about getting married : rethinking the gift of singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage , instead of this moldy oldy .

i found this book embarrassing to read - not because it 's risque , but because it so clearly illustrates how the french & italians got their reputations as great lovers .
is this the best that english literature can give us ?
this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy , let alone female sexuality .
it 's also mean-spirited .
lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman , and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept .
this is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal .
he drips way too much contempt .
everything outside of sex is dumb , meaningless , ridiculous .
attempting to derive enjoyment from the " mental life " makes one ridiculous ; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous ; trying to have sex in any way outside lawrence 's own true and correct way makes one pathetic , or defective , or spiteful ; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of " woman " or " man " ; and so on .
looking at italian art is stupid .
everything in paris is stupid .
constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in france knows how to have sex properly .
reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what 's " wrong " with everyone except c. and m. , one might easily conclude that constance does n't really seem happier now that she 's sleeping with the gamekeeper , and hilda does seem happier in venice - the author counters this by ridiculing " that kind " of happiness as delusional and druglike .
he even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there 's something wrong with her .
of course constance is wretched , because she does not have that one thing that , in lawrence 's view , really matters in life - not mellors , but mellors ' equipment .
this book does degenerate into phallus-worship , which makes the author 's hostility toward " druglike " pleasures seem sort of ironically comical .
hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures : from venice , from the feel of the sun , from jazz , from dancing .
this seems weird to me - as if lawrence is punishing the uppity woman .
hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a " user " , with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man , only to walk away when the dance is over .
( this may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist , since obviously lawrence does n't mind if mellors is callous and behaves as a " user " .
)

it 's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one 's body .
everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex , but his notion of real sex .
this is where astute readers will have the most trouble .
lawrence clearly defines a " real " woman - constance chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples .
a woman who lays there " unfeeling " is clearly an example .
such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc .
lawrence does n't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or is n't doing could even be related ; it 's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically , but in character .
on the other hand , a woman with an unfeminine urge to be in control - that is , one who insists on moving herself , rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when michaelis is the male ( because he 's premature , and meant to be pathetic ) , but it turns unforgiveable when it 's women in general and especially mellor 's bertha , who just refused to come when she should out of spite .
bertha just had a sick ( !
) urge to be in control , demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature .
the only thing mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he " spoilt " her .
as for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy ?
forget it .
lawrence suggests that mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch , but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental , nothing important .
a real woman does n't need foreplay .
just hop on and go , and if she 's what she ought to be , she 'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later .
these were what i found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman 's duty is to lie there , not too passive , but not too active , and come when she 's supposed to ( and if she does n't , it 's her own fault ) ; while a man 's job is to climb on top and " perform " .
all of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are , unfortunately , not true .
the truth is that a woman 's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis ; there 's a thing that both males and females start out with , which in a man becomes the penis , and in the woman becomes ( or remains ) a clitoris .
lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part .
women have always known about their own bodies ; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things , preferably apart from what women think men " want to hear " .
this , too , is no doubt why it has been accused of being " sexist " .
the author ( or at least mellors ) openly blames women who can not or will not " come to the crisis " when she ought , as if it were entirely of the woman 's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man .
it 's also likely that science will eventually prove ( if it has n't already ) that women like constance chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be ' emotionally as well as physically .
for all that lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly , even noxious emotions and desires - such as " intimacy " and " connection " , both of which he has constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act , but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences , based on the notion that a man 's biological job is to get his dna out there , while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment .
if this is true , it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant , not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child .
so - while there may or may not be women who feel as constance does , at the same time it 's not so clearly obvious that a woman " should " feel that way , as to justify lawrence 's open belittling of women whose emotional states do n't match masculine emotional detachment and distance .
there 's a lot of talk of " tenderness " - in fact , constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in venice of somehow " lacking tenderness " - but quite frankly i am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender .
the only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her , but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find .
i can imagine a woman putting up with - but i can not imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk , who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal ( remembering she 's a lady ) when she asks him questions , who calls her c--t as if that were her name , and generally treats her as if she were a whore .
i could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of , but this is how their relationship really is ; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he wo n't say and the questions he wo n't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible .
for what it 's worth , i think life will be better when this book has become obsolete .
it is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages , if not their selves .
those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion .
as for those who just want a good read - i 'd call it a matter of personal taste .
obviously some people enjoy this book .
( equally obviously , i did not .

lets say you were reading a book on the mafia , written by john gotti , or perhaps some lesser-known mobster .
and there was nothing but glowing accolades for the mob and it 's activities .
furthermore , anyone who opposed the mafia and it 's activities was labeled an " extremist " and in the text , their names were never more than about 4 or 5 words away from words like " ku klux klan , " " racist , " " bigoted , " or " paranoid , " you 'd begin to suspect that the book was a bit biased , would n't you ?
" americas uncivil wars " is a book written by mark lytle , a professor at bard college .
he documents events in american history , in this book , from the 1950 's to about 1975 .
practically every time a genuine conservative individual , or organization is mentioned in this book , it is associated to a racist organization , whenever mr. lytle does n't add his own commentary .
for example , on page 22 , he says joseph mccarthy revealed himself as a " mean-spirited slob .
" this is a far cry from the mccarthy i know , the mccarthy who wrote the brilliant " americas retreat from victory " for example .
and forget about anything good mentioned about the john birch society .
page 138 : " most americans ignored the hooded klansmen , the john birchers , and other extremists... " never mind the fact that jbs is not and never was a racist or an extremist organization .
but here is their name , sandwiched between the kkk and " extremist .
"

it is a typical tactic of the left to associate the opposition with the " stench of racism " as stalin may have put it ( i do n't remember his exact quote ) .
but you might ask , what about on page 89 where he refers glowingly to william f. buckley as " the cornerstone of the anti-communist wing of conservatism... ?
" keep in mind that this is the same buckley who years later , in lingua franca magazine , confessed that he would be a " mike harrington socialist " or a " communist " if he were college brat today .
now on the other hand , try to find anywhere in this book , the words " murderer , " or even " extremist " in front of names like mao tse tung , or che guevara or tom hayden , to name a few .
there is a good reason for that , but i will leave it to your imagination , the reason why .
in summary , should you decide to read this book , take it with a grain of salt , or better yet some motion-sickness pills because unless you are prone to the same convictions as our professor lytle is , you 're going to need a barf-bag

the most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content , but , based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers , that most people actually believe this drivel .
how can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed ?
the answer is that we can not .
i will not bother to go through a detailed criticism , not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it , but because , in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in , no one would believe it .
today , the " truth " depends much more on one 's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence .

i was disapointed when i downloaded it and got 8 pages .
as a customer , i expected to have the digital version of the full book and not a summary .
i thought that the price difference was due to the absence of paper , printing , handling , shipping , etc .
the hardcover version is more than 300 pages ; if you take the price per page of the digital version , the hardcover version should cost then ten times more ! ! !
all the examples are referred to that version and nowhere i was said that i was paying 5 dollars for a completely different product .
i honestly believed that i was buying the full book .

this guide to church growth has gained popularity during the recent trend of mega-church models and numerical prowess in evaluating the current health and future viability of individual churches .
many of the theories and models are based on business studies and business growth theories .
while the guide may be helpful in identifying strengths and weaknesses in your local congregation , its theories for projecting future growth or your church 's demise are analyzed using european and urban models , and have limited insight into the unique dynamics of the christian church in the varied regions of north america as a whole .
most limiting in this perspective is the distinctly spiritual aspect of church growth which results in a gigantic disparity in trying to compare churches and businesses .
this is a manual for analyzing and strategizing , for plotting and planning to stock more " seats in the pews , " and makes no significant mention of the actual spiritual journey or genuine troubles and struggles of the very real person searching for belief .
the philosophies of this book graphically illustrates why some other christian writers such as eugene peterson , contend that too many pastors view the members of their churches as assets to be managed rather than human souls with questions , concerns , needs and priorities of their own .
issues that can not be forgotten in the numbers game of current church growth modalities

everything about it--the writing , the characters , the story--is godawful .
here follows an absolutely true story .
while i was forcing myself to read this drivel , i went out on date .
she and i were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it .
i was advocating the 25 page litmus , and she insisted on at least fifty .
she did several long train commutes a week to and from work , and so read a lot of novels .
anyway , i started describing this book .
she recognized it immediately , and interrupted me saying , &quot ; the bear went over the mountain !
do n't read another word !
if you think it 's bad now , it only gets worse , if you can believe it ! &quot ; she was right .

i found the book thought-provoking , but there is more to philosophy than provocation .
the common underlying argument of this book , and its only valid statement as ethics , is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior , the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in .
this results-oriented approach is all very well , but singer does n't really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument .
virtually all of singer 's arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept .
if you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument ; if you do n't accept the premise , its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion .
in short , these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline .
how useful you find this is up to you .
i personally do n't know singer from adam and had not received any prior indoctrination about how groundbreaking he was before i picked up the book ; as a result , i have trouble seeing what people are so excited about

i originally wrote a review of this book in 1999 , titled " this is a racist book disguised as a work of art .
" it seems that i did n't explain well enough my objection to styron 's co-opting of the story of a real human being , nat turner , whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book , " the confessions of nat turner , " by t.r .
gray .
not only did styron steal the title of gray 's book , in which gray recounts his interview with the real nat turner , but the incidents styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism .
unlike his depiction in styron 's book , nat turner was married .
styron 's invention of turner 's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman , margaret whitehead , is entirely fictional .
so is any self-doubt that turner did the right thing by leading the revolt .
in gray 's account , turner did not express regret .
there is so much more depth to turner 's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book .
do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction ?
yes .
the parts styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented .
turner 's fictional relationship with margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit , for which they must die .
that styron crawls into nat turner 's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates turner and diminishes his cause .
what offends me most is that nat turner 's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this african-american hero .
instead , we have william styron 's version of turner 's life , taken by many readers as fact .
if one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life , then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of " confessions .
" but if one prefers reality , i recommend gray 's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at southampton , virginia .
styron 's book does not provide significant insights into nat turner , slave revolt or slavery itself .
his book clouds the truth with the same kind of reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching

i really love amanda quick , but this one just did n't work .
we do n't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together ; the action starts after they 've already spent a week getting to know each other .
very disappointing from a romance novel .
and i do n't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels , but the plot in this one defies belief .
it 's never explained why the first murder even occurs .
the hero 's fear that the murderer will focus on venetia because she 's using the last name " jones " is beyond ludicrous .
if that was going to be a major plot point , at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together .
but jones ? !
all would be forgiven if the romance were compelling , but it was n't in the slightest .
i will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library

this novel of a 17th century samurai 's odyssey to europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way , but towards the end , endo does get in a few good points .
the style is somewhat pedantic and staid , but easy to read .
it 's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces .
the historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks .
i must admit i am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here .
i can only conclude that a lot of people who do n't really have much experience of japan , think they 've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly westernized piece of writing by a japanesese christian .
remember , not every japanese woman is a geisha , and not every japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai 's sword

the book had so much promise , but i find it to be disappointing in several ways , alas .
the recipes i 've tried have been delicious , and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative , although the discussions and instructions do n't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool , as would , for example , anything by julia child , marcella hazan , jacques pepin , or any of the king arthur flour baking cookbooks , all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes .
in this case , i was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before i bought the book .
were i a tyro , i do n't think this book would be the best introduction , although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying .
my biggest disappointment , though , is the organization of the book : ice cream recipes are " bundled " with their accompanying cookies , garnishes , and the like ; instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream , for example , we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches , with ice cream of any of several different flavor families .
one has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find , say , recipes for chocolate ice cream .
i would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes , by flavor and page number , right up front -- i do n't want to spend so much time looking for the flavor i want .
my next disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically attractive and most stylish but virtually illegible size and color .
my middle-aged eyes struggle desperately to read the book , even with my reading glasses on , and i surely ca n't prop the book 18-20 " back from my utensils , to read as i work without changing position , as i like to do with my cookbooks .
this is a case in which the author and editorial team seemed to have chosen ( admittedly very attractive ) style over function .
the book is very attractive , and the photographs are lovely -- but i would gladly sacrifice some beauty in favor of being able to read the recipes and discussions more easily .
my final disappointment is in the complexity and elaborateness of most of the " dessert packages , " for lack of a better word .
making the ice cream or sorbet and its accoutrements is , in most cases , a tremendously labor-intensive exercise .
i have opted for using some of the creative and delicious ice cream recipes and figuring out my own much simpler and easier garnishes and accompaniments .
i work a demanding job and have a house to run .
i love to cook , but ca n't devote as much time to making an ice cream sandwich , for example , as these recipes require .
so i use less of the book than i 'd wish .
over all , ms. luchetti 's sense of style and taste are impressive , and she seems superbly knowledgeable about frozen desserts .
and many of the ice cream recipes are lovely .
but i had hoped that this would be a book i would pull from the shelf much more often than i will , in fact , because the book is so difficult to use

then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids , with no plot development .

uh , not in this one .
the only sexy scene is on page 138 , and that 's not very good either .
the best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned

dr. freeman 's justly esteemed " lee 's lieutenants " -- a three volume work -- still stands ( despite the discovery of materials unavailable to dr. freeman when he first wrote in the 1930s and 40s ) as the baseline for any study of the army of northern virginia .
the cheap attempt by a modern publisher to squeeze a few cents out of the franchise , offered here , throws out two of every three words dr. freeman wrote to allow for a one-volume " abridgement " for those presumably too intimidated by the thought of reading three entire books .
the three-volume work , as dr. freeman wrote it , was reprinted fairly recently .
if that is no longer available on amazon , any decent sized used book store will have it in stock .

i have to agree with stephen haines .
this guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink .
he makes boehme a gnostic , the troubadors , the knights templar , william blake , the masons , jung , and finally , any physicist worth his salt .
i mean , some of these folks might not have been orthodox in their christian practice , but being heterodox does not make one a gnostic .
how did he forget meister eckhart , and sabbatai tzvi ?
if he has boehme as a gnostic , then these also are gnostic .
he never distinguishes between gnosticism as a group of sects , and gnostic practice , which pervades kabbalah , sufism,etc .

i 've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before , and have always been very pleased , but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth .
lp was the only guide we purchased , based on our previous experiences with them , but we had the chance to peruse others in the b&b 's we stayed in throughout our trip .
of all of them , i 'd rate the lp as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say , individual experiences may vary !
ireland has become a very expen $ ive tourist destination , so upon reflection , we would have been happier with the rough guide .
lp has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide , and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process .
i hate to say it , but i 'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best .
i 'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though .
our first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are .
i realize it was published two years ago , but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20 % more than lp listed .
that 's quite a jump for 2 years , indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition , or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update .
our second gripe was the local maps .
they failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities , and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones .
given the rarity of irish street signage , those maps would have been a god-send for navigation in towns .
also , and this may be a function of the 2003 printing , a lot of the towns in ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers , and lp 's maps rarely identified this .
a third , again related gripe is with the existance , or lack thereof , of the various restaurants , b&b 's , shops , etc .
listed in the guide .
probably 30 % of the restaurants in the guide just are n't there any more .
i realize they must have been when it went to print , but that did n't help us any .
our last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country .
granted , it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts , pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas .
unfortunately , we did n't just want to go where all the other tourists go , so this left our noses still further out of joint .
overall , i 'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well , both lp and rough guide do that .
if you want to keep the expenditures down , rough guide does it much better .
if you want to go all out , um , there 's probably a third option , but neither of these two will do it well .
if you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others , then this guide is the closest you 'll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although , in that case , i 'd really recommend getting two guides , one for each end of the spectrum .
one last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle/tomb/historic place !
if you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places , its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip

this is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message .
it should have been tiltled the " jewish mother " tree or something .
so the message was use me and use me and use me some more and after i 'm all used up , use me some more and i will be happy .
thats something we want to convey to children

much of this book is very one sided .
in particular the sections on the environment are distorted and now known to be incorrect .
the book would be much better if they had not shown their bias

ayelet waldman is a graduate of harvard law school , so i assume she 's an intelligent woman and a good lawyer .
she should stick to what she knows .
the fact that she 's married to a famous author does n't make her a writer .
her novel is poorly written , overly sentimental and , to put it bluntly , very dumb .
what 's next ?
padma lakshmi writing a novel because she 's married to salman rushdie ?

i had read a book about the french and indian war , one about the revolution and also the recent best seller,1776 .
i found the war that forged a nation an excellant addition to my understanding of this important period in american history .
i would highly recommend it .
very readable

there is n't much i can add to previous reviews of civilziation and its discontents .
my own reaction ( after 2 cracks at it , one in college , and one post- ) is one of bafflement and boredom .
with academic , convoluted language , freud discusses the role of the individual with his neuroses and his conflicts with socialization and civilization .
many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers--rousseau , for example .
his psychological conclusions have more or less been explored at length in his previous works .
therefore , the redeeming value is found , perhaps , in freud 's closing passages , eery portends of europe 's ugly years

unfortunately some audio books are read in monotone-very dull indeed-but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it 's story time and she 's a preschool teacher .
my daughters and i loved the main characters in audio books such as bridget jones diary , the nanny diaries , and sammy 's hill because the reader made us sympathize with them .
we knew that whatever the characters did they did with sincerity and whatever happened to them could happen to anyone .
emily gray , the reader of can you keep a secret , made the main character sound witless and very , very phony .
all of the other characters sounded one dimensional .
we listen to audio books on our frequent long car trips .
although we had nothing else to listen to at the time , we could only standof this book before we had to turn it off .
a few weeks later i randomly read a few chapters of can you keep a secret in a bookstore and thought that it was amusing .
perhaps emily gray did n't find the book amusing , so she thought that she needed to go " over the top " to add humor .
if so , it did n't work .
she took a lighthearted , enjoyable book and turned it into the equivalent of listening to nails on a blackboard .
